"Tom and Mia love snow. They wait for snow all year. When they see snow outside, they jump and clap. They put on warm hats, coats, boots and gloves. They run outside to play.

They make a big snowman with a carrot nose, a scarf and a hat. They give him a name. They call him Bob. They say hello to","Bob every time he snows in the sun. They also play hide and seek in the snow. It is fun.

But then, the wind blows hard. The snow falls slow and slippery. It covers Bob. He shivers and cries. His hat falls off. His mouth drops his hat. His eyes roll down. He looks sad.

Tom and Mia are sad too. They try to help Bob. They dig up him. But it is too late. Bob is gone. Tom and Mia cry. They wish their mom and dad were here.

Then, a nice lady comes. She has white hair, blue eyes, and a sweet smile. She sees Sam. She asks what happened. She gives them a hug. She says she will restore Bob's hat. She takes the hat from the snowman. She puts a band-aid on it. She ties the necklace around it. She"

One day, Tom and Mia want to go out again. They ask their mom if they can. She says yes, but they have to wear his jacket first. Tom and Mia are happy. They run inside. They hide behind the table. They hope Bob will come too.

But the next morning, something bad happens. A cat jumps into their room! It sees Bob in Max's coat coat. It wants to play with them. It scratches Bob. Pop! The coat rips. The carpet tipped over. Max falls down. Tom and Mia scream. Their snowman melted. Bob is gone. Tom and Mia are very sad.

Their mom finds what happened. She runs to Bob."

But then it starts to rain. The rain is heavy and cold. It makes the ground wet and muddy. Tom and Mia cannot see anything in the street. They feel sad. They want their snowman to be alive.

Mom sees them from the window. She calls them from inside. ""Come here, my loves! You need to dry off!"" she says.

Tom and Mia run inside. They sit by the door. They look out the window. They see more snow falling and soaks into the yard. But not just snow. Bob has landed! He has made snowmen, snowmen, snow angels and snow-clown clothes.

""Look, look!"" Tom shouts. He points at the snow piles of kids playing in the park. ""Bob is our friend. He likes the winter.""

Mia nods. She understands."

Tom and Mia do not mind. They think that Bob is nice. They throw snowballs at each other and laugh. They have fun.

But then, it starts to rain. The rain comes down hard. It makes loud noises. Tom and Mia get cold. They go back inside their house. They take off Bob's coat and coats. They dry them with a soft towel.

They look out the window again. They see Bob still standing by the fence. He is still shivering. He looks sad. He says, ""Rose-Boo"". His eyes blink. He wants to hear more.

Tom and Mia feel sorry for Bob. They know he likes winter. He has only three carrots left. He will be happy if"
"Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the garden. One day, they see a small egg in a nest. They want to look at the egg.

""Can I hold the egg?"" Lily asks.

""No, it is mine!"" Ben says. He rushes to the nest and grabs the egg.

""Give it back!"" Lily cries. She runs after Ben.

Ben runs away","with the egg. Lily chases him. They run and run until they reach their house.

Mom sees them running. She is not happy.

""Where did you get that egg?"" she asks.

Lily and Ben shrug. They hide the egg under the pillow.

""Did you break the egg?"" Mom asks.

They nod. They are sorry.

Mom hugs them. ""It's okay. You should have asked me first. The egg was very important for the baby's bed. Now it will wake up.""

She puts the egg on the table. It smells sweet.

Lily and Ben smile. They say thank you to Mom.

They learn a lesson. They don't touch things that are not theirs. They listen when Mom tells them not to do something bad. They are happy to be together. And they love"

Ben runs away","with the egg. Lily chases him. She wants to keep the egg for herself.

They run and run until they reach the fence. The nest is on the ground near the pond. The eggs fall out of the nest.

Lily and Ben stop running. They look at the broken eggs.

""Who did this?"" Ben asks. ""Now we have no eggs.""

""I don't know,"" Lily says. ""But we can make another nest.""

They find some more sticks and leaves. They work hard to restore their nest. They put some more feathers inside.

The next day, Lily and Ben go to check on their nest. It is still there! But now it is gone. There is only one crack under the wings.

""Oh no!"" Lily says. ""Our nest is gone!""

Ben runs away","from her. He looks for a place to hide the egg. He sees a big leaf on the ground. He picks up the leaf and puts it under his waist. He covers the hole with some leaves.

Lily stops and peeks again. She does not see the egg. She walks closer and closer. She does not hear the crunch or chirp.

Suddenly, she hears a loud crack. The egg falls out of her mouth and rolls down the hill. It goes into the river and gets smaller and smaller. Lily screams and cries.

She runs after the egg but it swims away too fast. She cannot catch it. She feels sad and angry.

A voice calls her name. It is Mommy. She comes to help her.

""What happened, my little angels?"" Mommy asks. ""Did you lose your egg?""

""We found an egg! But we were not careful,"" Ben says.

Mom looks at the nest. It is big and old. Some eggs have cracked or died. She shakes her head.

""These are not safe pets. These are called antsl. And don't touch the egg again. It is disgusting,"" she says.

Lily and Ben feel sorry. They did not know that pets could hurt themselves or make trouble.

"Sara and Ben are playing in the yard. They see a big iron on the grass. It is old and rusty. Sara wants to touch it, but Ben says no.

""It is dirty and sharp. It can hurt you,"" Ben says.

Sara does not listen. She runs to the iron and picks it up. She feels something","cold and slimy inside. She drops it and coughs.

""Ow! Ow! Ow!"" she screams. She holds her arm and sees blood. The iron has pricked her finger. Blood comes out of her hand.

Ben hears Sara's cry and runs to help her. He hugs her and says sorry.

""I told you not to touch the iron. You were right. You should have listened to me,"" he says.

They go to their mom and show her Sara's wound. Mom is busy working on another project. She needs some cream and ice to feel better.

She puts some cream on Sara's cut and warmly gives them some water. She tells them they have to be careful and follow the rules next time. She takes away the iron and throws it into the trash.

Ben hears her cry and comes to help. He sees what Sara did and stops her. He takes the iron away from her and puts it back in the box.

Sara nods and hugs him. ""You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you for helping me,"" she says.

They walk back to their house, holding hands. They do not want to play with the iron anymore. They decide to find another game that they like and not play near the fence. They hope the sun will be bright and warm soon. Then they can go outside and play again. But not now, because there is one hot day at noon. We have to hurry because it is very far from home.

She looks up and sees a man with a yellow hat and a black coat. He has a basket of tools in his hand. He smiles at them.

""What are you doing, children?"" he asks.

""We found a shiny thing. We wanted to play with it,"" Sara says.

The man laughs. ""That is not a real thing. That is a mild metal. You could get burned or break something,"" he says.

He walks over to Sara and takes the metal away. He gives her a hug and a band-aid for her finger.

""I'm sorry you got hurt. But you should always ask before you touch something that is hot or sharp. And you should always be careful with things you find in"

"His friend, Sam, was running around with a whip. He was very good at making it snap. ""I can make a loud sound with my","whip,"" he said as he swung the whip around.

Sam laughed and tried to copy his friend's loud noise. But it felt strange because of the whip. Soon his hands were filthy! ""Ew!"" Sam exclaimed. 

Tim followed him and asked what had happened.  He could tell he needed to be cleaned up.

So Sam grabbed a bucket of water and some soap. Then he scrubbed all the dirt off himself until it shone like gold. When he finished washing away, his whip looked so fresh and clean again.

""Thanks for helping me keep my whip tidy!"" Tim said to Sam in excitement. They both laughed and continued playing. It felt great that they had used their pretend whip for safety. The end.

"His friend, Sam, was running around with a whip. He was very good at making it snap. ""I can make a loud sound with my","whip,"" he thought to himself.

Sam soon saw the kids playing and asked if he could join in too. The kids were happy to let him use their whip because they wanted him to have fun! 

The three of them started making lively noises as each other chanted. It was lots of laughter and joy that lasted for days. Eventually, everyone joined in too, and the kids all had so much fun that the day passed quickly and before they knew it, the kids had been playing until it was time to go home. 

Before they left, Sam gave one final warning: ""Remember to always show you with your whip, okay? Don't forget to come back for dinner."" The kids waved goodbye and ran off home happily. They were glad that they got to play together with their noisy whip. What a great evening it had been! Now, whenever it"
"His friend, Sam, was running around with a whip. He was very good at making it snap. ""I can make a loud sound with my","whip!"" he said proudly to his friends and family.

One day, while they were playing in the garden, it started raining really hard. The whip flew off Sam's finger and into the sky! Everyone started to worry that their friend would get hurt. 

Suddenly, Sam noticed something unusual ahead of him: his tail had been torn off by some drops of water! As soon as he looked down, he spotted that his friend's tail had fallen over a nearby tree branch.

Sam ran up and hugged his friend tightly - ""Don't worry, I will help you fix your tail."" He took out two pieces of soft leaves from his house and wrapped them around both of Sam's tail. With one last tug, all the wet stuff disappeared underneath!

His best friend cheered and thanked him for helping him. ""You are so clever,"""

Sam smiled and said, ""That sounds like fun!"" 
The two of them started to swing the whip back and forth in different directions, so they could both try it. It felt really nice! After a few tries, Sam eventually made his whip go very high up into the sky. The little birds came flying in from far away and flapped their wings.

When Sam finally got off, he was smiling again, but this time Sam's smile had been a big blue one. They laughed and ran around together for hours until dinner. Before they headed inside, the friends shared a hug. Their soccer plan had worked perfectly.

""We did it together,"" said Sam. 
His face filled with joy. ""Yay!""  And everyone lived happily ever after.""

"Once upon a time there was a boy. His name was John and he wanted an adventure. One day he decided to go and follow a factory. He ran and ran and eventually he arrived at the factory.

When John arrived at the factory it was very big and very noisy. He peeked inside and saw","lots of workers working, carrying machines and making things.
John didn't know what they were doing so he followed them into the factory. Inside, he found some tools - some pliers and lots of wires. 

The workers noticed John too and asked him why he looked around.
""I am just exploring,"" said John. ""What are these machines?""
A lady replied with a smile on her face: ""These are used for lots of cool things like paints or tools.""

Suddenly, an old man appeared from behind the machines and said: ""We all have different tools, but we can also help people!"" 
John thought about this, then understood that he could be brave and explore the factory himself. 
He thanked the woman and happily left the factory. From that day forward, John always remembered his curiousness and bravery when faced with the mystery of machines. The End.

John wondered what they meant by different colours, but his friends didn't understand.

Suddenly one of the workers had an idea. They explained that some people are always nice and would use the rules to have fun together like they did. This made John really happy! 

John soon forgot about the factory for a few days. Every day he thought of the people and enjoyed playing in the colorful streets from overstairs with him. Whenever he went outside, the worker would come out to talk to him. And every day after, John waved goodbye as he left the factory door open. 

John never felt so excited when he got home again. Even if things didn't work just right, he still continued to explore new places in the future. And he was glad he got to hear all about how many friendly people existed on"

They gave him some money as a reward for his courage and went home happy. From then on, every time someone came to the factory, John remembered what it had been like to have a disagreement with each other, because now that everyone gets used up from the noisy factory, John would always remember how brave he was that day and hopeful he could come back again soon.

The robot said hello and asked if he could help him get back home. John thought this sounded fun so he said yes. The robot then helped John find his way back to his house. When they reached the door, it opened and closed behind them. 

John thanked the robot for helping him. They waved goodbye as he left. As the engine drove away in the bad situation, John was reminded of how brave the robot had been and that everything would be okay. And ever since that day, whenever John goes through the factory he always listens carefully to make sure it is ready before crossing. The End. 

That night John has been a very smart little explorer. Everyone who sees him is proud of himself for being brave and following the order"
"One day, Tom found a big box. He had a joke idea. He thought, ""I will hide in the box and jump out to surprise my friends."" Tom got in","the box and went downstairs. 

Tom played with his ball while he waited for his friends to find him. He hid behind the couch, but it was very quiet in the house. Soon, all of his friends started looking for him. They looked under the table, behind the door, and even in the closet. But they could not find Tom because he was hiding so well.

Finally, Tom's friend called out, ""Where are you?"" But there was no answer. His joke worked! Tom's jokes made everyone laugh. At last, Tom opened his eyes and laughed too. They both loved the big box and the funny jokes inside. And from that day on, Tom always knew how to surprise his friends. The end. The moral value is: never hide alone when someone finds your way.

Tom was sad because he could not see the thing again. His friend came out of the empty box and said sorry for making a mess. They hugged and played together all day long. And they always remembered their funny joke adventure. The end. The end. The bad ending meant that they never found another big hole to play their jokes game again.

The joke joke game made everyone happy, and they played together all day long. Tom and Sally laughed and had so much fun.

"Tim carried the rod and went to the river. He put the rod in the water and waited for a fish to come. Suddenly, a big fish came and","jumped out of the river! The fish was so excited that it jumped up and started eating some food. 
Tim watched with great delight as he carried more baites in his line. When the fish had finished eating, it thanked him and scampered away into the trees.

So he looked at the duck with his big eyes. The duck was so gentle that she didn't bite him! After looking at her, Tim felt a bit jealous because he thought she had taken good care of it. 

He asked the duck, â€œCan you do something else? Can you please pick me up?"" 

The duck just shook her head and disappeared into the bushes.

Tim was getting very frustrated, but then he had an idea. He decided to tie his wrist with the rod and the bait would pull him up into the water again! It worked! Tim pulled himself high up into the sky and the next thing he saw were more little fishes in the water. 

He smiled with delight as they swam around in their new, deep blue waters. Now Tim can get even bigger fishes whenever he wants! That's why he has on every day to help the most people - tying them in the same way! The End. Even when it seems like a bit difficult, if you work hard, something will happen. With some patience, great things can happen. With just one strong stretch of air and an open mind, this is what makes us stronger."" And that's how Tim learned his lesson"

""Oh no!"" cried Tim. ""My rod is gone! I can't find it again.""
He ran back home and told his mom what happened. She helped him look until they finally found the rod hiding under a rock. They were so happy that the rod was safe. 
Tim's dad said, ""I'm so proud of you for finding your rod. Now let's go give it a nice treat!"" 
They brought some candy and then walked home together. When they got there, Tim held up the candy. His dad smiled and gave it to him, saying he could eat it while they hugged. 
The end.
 Tim was still a bit sad when the rod got lost but he didn't mind though - he had an exciting adventure! And he was thankful that he remembered how lucky he was to have such a great rod! The End."
The water started to move. The pot with the fat cat began to sail. The fat cat was scared. He did not want to,"be outside of a pan in the river. But he was also curious and brave.

He sailed faster and faster until he could see the other side. He felt happy and safe, but then he saw something bad. There were big splashes at the bottom! It was dangerous and made him wet and cold. 

The lazy cat felt scared again. He slowly steered his boat back to safety. When he arrived home he told his family what had happened. They knew how special it would be to have stayed out late in night, even when he was young. Now the fat cat is feeling much braver than before.

He learnt an important lesson that day - to always stay away from danger. Not everything can get you done unless you look for help. Even if it means going through tough times! So now every time you go to bed, remember that even in darkest moments like a panworms cannot handle. And rem"

Suddenly, he saw a big tree at its top point. It looked safe and strong. He wanted to find out where it went!
He sailed towards the tree until he came upon a tiny little home. It had lots of tasty bugs inside. With help from one friend the fat cat decided to make a fire and burn some food for everyone.
The small place would last forever. Everyone was happy and they stayed there all day. Soon enough, it got dark outside but the fat cat remembered the special thing he found: that burning things can be very helpful.
Finally, the lazy cat went home, thankful he returned to the nest. His warm burrow remained as comfortable as ever. And sure enough, even on wet days, he could enjoy the fire whenever it rained nearby. 

The End. Fit's adventure has ended with a little better rem"
The water started to move. The pot with the fat cat began to sail. The fat cat was scared. He did not want to,"be far from his home.

The fat cat asked a big bird for help. ""Please bring me to my home,"" he said, sadly.

The big bird looked around and noticed something that made him smile. It was an old tree branch that had been there in need of fixing. The rope it was tied around the old rock was strong enough to carry the dry leaves down. 

""Thank you!"" said the big bird happily. The nest below the leaf held the weak wood from now on, just like a little mouse could have stayed at home forever. 

The fat cat smiled, grateful for the help that his friend needed. Together they sailed away until the end of their journey. Then they sailed back together. 

And ever since then, the fat cat never felt so happy and content when it was all along - he knew how important it was to help others! He even promised himself to always keep things dry"
The water started to move. The pot with the fat cat began to sail. The fat cat was scared. He did not want to,"get wet. But he remembered something his mother had told him: if he ever got wet, he should stay very still and wait until the sun goes down. So he stayed still. After a few moments, the fat cat decided that it was time for him to go back home. He slowly rowed towards his house, still wide. 

When he arrived at his doorstep the fat cat was happy to be dry again! His mom gave him an extra special treat; a big hug and said ""Now you won't have to worry anymore"".

The fat cat knew that the next day would bring something even better - puddles! From then on, he would always remember this moment of happiness when he sailed out of home and waited patiently to come back. He always felt safe knowing he could find nice treats in the future.

And they all lived happily ever after! The End. It will be once more special than any one"
"One day, Max saw a cat named Luna. Luna was good at taking things off. Max asked Luna for help with his collar. Luna tried to help, but","the tag did not fit her. 

Max said, ""Luna, you have a nice collar."" Luna looked in her pocket and found a toy that she wanted to give away. Max thought it would be funny to make the doll ugly. But Max had an idea.

Max took out a pink ribbon from his pants. He tied it around the doll's neck to show it was just right. Luna looked silly, but Max was happy to see her smile. Now, Luna could play without her expensive dress or any other ugly hair! They both laughed and played together happily ever after. The end.

Max wanted to solve the problem by helping Luna. He thought and thought. Then, he had an idea! Luna used her head to find things that were difficult for her. They found sticks and leaves to keep them in place. Max said, ""Luna, you can take this too!""

They both learned how to use the leash to play together. Now, they take long walks each day with their new puppy friend.

Later, Max found a big stick. He wanted to use this to make the long rope longer so he could carry Luna more easily. But Luna did not want to. She said ""No!"" and ran away with him. Max kept trying to get her, but Luna did not listen. 

Max was getting tired and went back to find Luna. This time, he looked around and found Luna stuck in some mud. Max helped Luna take her bath from the pond. In no time, they were clean again.

"Sam knew how important hats were, so he decided to provide her with his hat. The little girl was so happy and","thanked Sam for being so compassionate and caring.

They walked over to the store and asked if they could buy a new hat for Sam's friend. Sam smiled proudly and said she would help him find something suitable for his neighbor, who looked beautiful in it too!

She grabbed the hat and ran off with it. But then she noticed a problem - she had forgotten about where she put it! She looked everywhere but couldn't find it anywhere. She was sad because she thought she wouldn't be able to wear the hat anymore. 

Just then, Sam saw another hat in the garden. He asked if he could borrow it this time. This time the other one said yes and gave it back to Sam.

Sam was very grateful and promised never to lose her hat again. From that day onwards, Sam always used the hat to store his favourite things as a special gift from home. The end.

But then something bad happened, while they were playing, the hat started to look ugly. It had broken it on purpose when you pulled its handle. 

The two friends tried to fix it but nothing worked. So they asked for help.

When their mum saw them from inside, she smiled and said: ""I have some tools that I can use in the garden. Let's give the hat a good job.""

After a few days of playing, Sam went back home but she still hadn't noticed the cold snow outside. He wanted something cold, but there wasn't any. Then, Sam realized that the perfect hats would have to be warmer than usual! She ran to get them right away and immediately started throwing them around the house. 

But then all of a sudden, her mom yelled ""Stop!"" She scolded Sam for being too loud and warned her to always stay inside when she needed something nice. From then on, Sam only put hats near the fireplace where there was enough heat to make sure nobody got hurt again. 

Sam learnt an important lesson about asking permission before using things from now on. Whenever someone need help they should try to be careful not"

One day, Sara and Tom saw a new boy near the mill. He had a red hat and a blue bike. He looked at them and said, ""This is my mill.","I made it.""

Sara and Tom wanted to see the boy's truck. They went closer to him and tried to say hello. But the man in the wheel did not smile or talk much. He only frowned and pushed them away.

""Go away!"" he shouted. ""This is my mill. You can't touch it.""

The man with the boards got angry. He pointed his arms and kicked them hard. He screamed loudly and crashed into the wheel of the mill. It broke into pieces.

Sara and Tom fell down from the wheel. They were hurt and sad. They cried for help. The man with the boards was also sorry. He thought someone would hear their cries if they came.

But no one came. The mill was empty and wet. No one helped Sara and Tom. They never played by the old mill again. They learned to be careful"

Sara and Tom felt sad for the new boy. They wanted to be his friend. But one of the people in the mill did not like strangers. He told Sara and Tom to stay back.

""Go away! You are mean!"" he said. ""You have no right to touch my mill!""

But then, he saw something shiny on the ground. It was an oyster. It sparkled in the sun and made him happy. He picked it up and ran away.

The new boy came back from his walk. He saw the oyster and thought it was a toy. He took it from the mill and opened it. Inside, there were many pearls inside. Someone had found them and buried them underground.

The new boy was very angry when he saw what the other boy did. He shouted at Sara and Tom, ""Who gave me this shell? This"

The boy shook his head. ""I don't care,"" he said. ""My house has no toys. I only have this old rag. It's heavy and warm. You can sit here by myself.""

Sara and Tom felt angry. They wanted to show him their hill. They ran to the river and kicked his ball into the water.

The new boy was sad. He lost his ball. He cried and said, ""That is not nice. You should share your things with others.""

Sara and Tom did not listen. They kept kicking the hill and making loud noises.

A man who worked there heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. He saw Sara and Tom kicking his ball and the bucket of dirt. He asked them why they did it.

Sara and Tom said they found the hill, but they did not want to help the other boy or the bucket. They thought it was selfish of him to take more than his things.

"Mickey decided to climb up the table to get a closer look at the cheese. He stared at it for a long time, wondering how he could get a piece of it. Suddenly, he heard","his mom's voice from inside the house: ""Mickey! You can try and open the fridge!""

Mickey quickly put down the chair and ran into the kitchen. But when he got there, he was surprised by what he saw - a big yellow banana jar! 

His mom smiled and said, ""That looks like you've gotten an empty bag on your bottom-in-covered face. Let me help you."" She grabbed some snacks from the cupboard, gave Mikey a few extra pieces, then took them off the counter. The milk spilled onto the floor and made a funny shape in it. 

Mikey looked around, amazed at all of its different shapes. His mother watched with a smile, proud that her son had worked so hard to get what he wanted. What an exciting day Mickey was having! He scrambled back to the table to enjoy"

Mickey was sad, he really wanted to take the cheese home with him, but Mama was firm. With an urge to reach down low enough to grab it before putting it back on the table. 
He looked around to see if there were any cheese left in the house, so he spotted one underneath the table. As soon as he got close to the spot where the cheese must be, he put his hand out. To his amazement, the cheese had a cracking sound!

Mickey was so frustrated that he started crying. His father smiled and said, ""Don't worry, Mickey. You can have one slice if you try not to be crazy!""

He went over to the plate and munched away on another slice. After eating, he took a bite and felt better, but still didn't like it. ""This is yucky,"" he muttered to himself.

Suddenly, an idea came to him. From this spot again, he would be able to go to the dinner table and eat the rest of the last piece! He laughed and began eating with a huge smile on his face. From then on, he remembered what his dad had told him about being silly before."

""It's ok,"" Wendy said when the lady finally looked up and saw that she wasn't there anymore. The other person came out of their house and pointed outside the window. As Wendy walked towards it she noticed something moving in the grass. 

As she got closer, Wendy realised it was a big cat! Her face lit up as she realized it must have been playing hide-and-seek with her! In that moment she forgot all about how silly she was for running into such a messy place before, and ran back inside and continued playing happily with her cat by her side.

Wendy smiled. Her teacher asked what she wanted for her test. Wendy thought carefully, then said something strange: ""Follow me!""

Her mom was not sure if Wendy had a good idea. But in her head Wendy said ""Come on, I have a great surprise!""

The other lady went ahead to get ready, but it was a difficult task. Everywhere the teacher looked there were lots of girls wearing the same things as her. After some time Wendy got frustrated and decided she did not want anyone else in the way. It took too long for her so she finished her work without saying anything.

When she showed her new exam, everyone laughed at the silly thing they saw. But everyone still kept on telling everyone about it when Wendy started the next day, but this time they weren't too mad because now she knew better than anyone else - even the most embarrassing"

Wendy thought for a minute and then she remembered something she had learned from the day before. She picked up her pencil and started looking around at the other people wearing big shirts, or the woman with the most colorful dress? Then she ran back to her dad who was standing beside them all. She told him everything and he hugged her tightly. His face lit up when his eyes blinked too! He said ""You found the perfect answer, so that everyone can have some fun!"" Wendy beamed with pride. From then on, every time she saw her teacher, they would start their special adventure together, and Wendy knew exactly how helpful someone"
"As she walked, she met a little boy named Timmy. Timmy asked, ""Can I help you carry that wood?"" Lily was hesitant at first, but she let Timmy help","her with the axe.

Timmy said, ""I think this tool is useful for my axe."" He showed Lily how to use it and told her to be careful because it was sharp. They worked together for a while, chopping out small pieces of wood into little piles. 

When they finished, Lily thanked Timmy for helping her and saying goodbye. She felt proud that she could do something all by herself. From that day on, whenever Lily saw someone struggling with a small piece of wood, she remembered what kind of help she needed to do and thought about what she had learned when she faced her fears. The moral of the story is that even though we may not always know anything right or wrong, we can still accomplish something if we try our best enough. And even if things are difficult, it's important to keep trying and never give up. What's important is who we believe in ourselves and make us"

When they arrived back home, Timmy said, ""Thank you for helping me with my work, Lily. You are such an honest friend."" From that day on, Lily knew that it was always good to be honest and help others when needed. And even though some things might get dirty or dirty, their kindness made them feel good in the end.

Later on, they went to the park. They played on the swings, climbed on the jungle gym, and made new friends along the way. When it started to get dark, Lily said goodbye to Timmy and gave him a big hug before she left. She felt happy that she had helped someone and learned something new. 

The next day, as Lily went home, she thought about all the other things she had done when she saw Timmy carrying his big tool.

One day, Lucy was out in the garden. She saw a","big tree and decided to measure it with her cup of water. The water was very slippery! It made her think - how much better the view from the park could be to the top. 

She carefully measured each of the branches in the tree, until she was sure they were perfect. But when she tried to reach the top of one branch, she felt dizzy. Her dad came running over to help. With the strong ladder, Dad lifted her up so she could see the peak. They both looked around and enjoyed the beautiful view together. 

Lucy thought that the view from the tree really was amazing! Now she can't wait to explore even more, because the measurements were definitely something that would make her feel happy. 

The End. This story teaches us a valuable lesson: we should always take our time, because nothing is too heavy or too high for us to handle. If Lucy had been careful"
"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to measure things, especially colorful things. She had a special measuring glass that she liked to use.

One day, Lucy was out in the garden. She saw a","very bright yellow flower and decided to measure it with her tiny cup. As she measured the flower, a butterfly flew by. Lucy was so excited!

After finishing the measurement, Lucy found another colorful flower. It wasn't quite like this one, but instead of being colourful. Instead, it was purple - like the sky! Lucy thought it looked really nice and wondered where it came from. 

As Lucy continued to measure different kinds of flowers around the house, she kept smiling as she saw them come alive. Everywhere she went, something beautiful changed.

The end. But it is still a great way to know why some plants have grown, and how some are made with just some purple paint! That's what Sarah was learning! The world around her was no longer blue â€“ the trees were purple with pretty colours, and it sparkled and shone in the sun. 

And when"
"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to measure things, especially colorful things. She had a special measuring glass that she liked to use.

One day, Lucy was out in the garden. She saw a","tiny green sprinkle coming from a large plant. It was a special fruit! 

Lucy wanted to test if it really worked. So she carefully put down her cup and went over to it. As soon as she touched the seed with her finger, something amazing happened. A small rainbow-colored butterfly flew in and landed on the flower.

It fluttered around and then flew back up into the ground. The colours were so bright and beautiful! Lucy couldn't believe how beautiful it made her feel. 

From then on, whenever Lucy found an extra colourful surprise, she used her special ingredient to measure how wonderful it was. And everyone who saw them smiled when they saw her discovery. 

The end. Lucy discovered lots of new colors, magical creatures, even more beautiful ones. 
She smiled knowing she would always have fun at the same time, because now all the different"

One day, Lucy was out in the garden. She saw a","pink flower and smiled. She thought it would be fun to see how many colors grew on it! So she got down on her hands and reached for the petals of the flower.

But when she did, something terrible happened - the flower started to die! Lucy was sad and wondered why this had happened. But then something wonderful happened â€“ the flower returned! Lucy was so happy.

The end. Now Lucy loves doing amazing things with the pretty flowers. Whenever anything is too hard for you, just keep hoping. Even if your friends say no, look at their beautiful garden! The end. That made Lucy very happy. 

The End. What an exciting discovery! From then on, whenever someone tried something they could not stop thinking about it. They knew it was time to start having lots of fun together! And sure enough, one day they found a way to fix all of Lucyâ€™s worries together."

He brought some of his old oat sticks and grass and made a fire with them. The tiger watched from the corner and was very curious. After some time, he started to smell it. It smelled so good!

The wise man served up some oats, and the tiger happily gobbled them up. In no time, the elephant finished eating. Everyone in the jungle cheered as the tiger gave out more oat honey that everyone enjoyed.

The man said goodbye to the tiger and went back into the jungle. But something strange happened. The tiger was nowhere to be found!

He looked around and then he saw it. A monkey had been playing by the tree and it was eating bananas too! 

The man knew that this would be the last time he ever saw the monkeys, but he still wanted them to have their food. He kept walking until he reached out his hands to offer them one of his snacks.

To his surprise, the monkeys were so happy when they opened their teeth and gave him the snack. They all enjoyed the sweet treat together!

The next day, another zoo animal had passed by. When the zookeeper asked what happened, the kind man explained that he forgot his wallet at home. The zoo person said, ""I can help you find your wallet!"". They went into the forest together until they found it. 

But when they got back, the other animals had already given away some of their food and drinks. This made them feel sad because they couldn't give anything back to the tiger. The tiger was so grateful that he brought out his money and gave it to everyone who passed by on the way. And from then on, they became good friends. Everyone was so glad to receive their food from the kind and generous zoo.  The end. The wise man provided happiness in the jungle too!  From then on, people still look forward to going"
"His mom came in and asked, ""What's wrong, Timmy?"" 

""I'm bored,"" said Timmy. 

His mom said, ""I have an idea. Let's go outside and play with","the sand."" 

Timmy was excited and they went outside together. They made a big sand castle. It was so strong that it lifted up high! But then it started to rain. The water filled the sky and they had to go inside. 

At first, it was hard for Timmy to see his home anymore because of the powerful storm. But then he saw the stars coming out and the sun shone through them like magic. He realized that sometimes things can be different than we think they are really cool. And even though the weather still looks bad at first, it means their special moment will never end. From that day on, Timmy loved playing outside even more, but always kept a smile on his face. The end. The end. Sometimes, when something seems impossible or scary, a little bit of hope is real!

""I'm bored,"" said Timmy. 

His mom said, ""I have an idea. Let's go outside and play with","your friends."" 

Timmy went to his friend's house and they played together until it was dark outside. Then he said, ""Mom, can we stay here for a little bit longer? I'm tired now."" 

But then they heard a loud noise and they were scared. They ran inside and sat on the couch. But something bad happened that hurt their ears while they were waiting. 

Suddenly they saw some smoke coming from the kitchen! Someone had put a fire and the floor caught fire too quickly. Timmy's mom tried to get them out but the whole house was burning down. In the end, everyone lost everything and Timmy's day didn't end better. The end.

Timmy was excited and he put on his hat. They went outside and had a great time playing together. But then Timmy saw a big puddle of water and he wanted to splash around it. 

He tried to swim through the puddle but he slipped and fell into the puddle. His clothes got wet and muddy. He was not happy anymore. 

But then, his mom showed him that they could change out of their clothes because she didn't want them to get dirty again. Soon enough, Timmy's clothes were clean again and he felt much better. From then on, Timmy learned to be careful when playing near puddles. The end. The end.

His mom said, ""I have an idea. Let's go outside and play with","your toy cars."" 

Timmy loved the idea, so he went out with his mom. They put their cars on a big track and started racing them around. Suddenly, it got very dark inside. 

""Mom, I think there is going to be a storm soon!"" exclaimed Timmy. 

But then they heard a loud noise coming from outside. The wind was blowing hard and making the ground shake. The sky turned gray and they realized that their favorite game had ended without any more fun.

"Once upon a time, there was a girl called Amelia who lived a long way away in a far-off universe. One day, she decided she wanted to explore. She looked up at the night sky and the stars were so big and bright.

“I want to fly up there!” she said to her mum.

“No, Amelia. You can’t","her mind!

So instead of flying over to Earth, Mum taught me how to be careful and smart - like when we cross the sea.""

Amelia agreed that being careless wasn't fun but it made her really proud. Everyday Amelia had a hard time learning new things, as the rest of her family were always watching from afar.

One day, Ivy saw something wonderful: a starfish, twinkling in the sunlight and flying across the sky! Whenever Ity reached out to touch the starfish, she would whisper ""look what I found!"" 

Mum told her with all her heart and encouraged her to keep trying. From then on, Amelia remembered to stay brave no matter what. With courage and determination, Amelia never stopped exploring the universe. And whenever she visited the starfish again, she knew she could learn something important by saying 'please'.

And from that"

“I want to fly up there!” she said to her mum.

“No, Amelia. You can’t","it?â€™.

Mum shook her head sadly. â€œWe are all very far away here, sweetheart, but I still wish you could come too!â€

Amelia started to cry. She was not going anywhere else without dreaming about what she would see if she left with her family soon. 

The next day, Mum took me to visit an ancient museum. She opened the door, and out stepped a handful of jewelry! It was so beautiful that both girls knew they must have found something really special! 

Amelia had been so curious about what was inside of her own, she forgot all about her fears and explored the old universe with her two little kids. 

She learned that life isn't just anything; sometimes the things we do aren't real! We should always stick with your love, no matter how small they may seem. That will help"

“I want to fly up there!” she said to her mum.

“No, Amelia. You can’t","have some wisdom from learning about it!

So, instead of flying like wearing a special hat or pretending to be something else. Even if I could not move around, you had to believe in yourself.

Amelia put on the hat and started jumping, feeling so proud of herself. She felt so small, but also very wise. Whenever she would fly, she thought of something really magical that made her feel like nothing was impossible - because the sun was right above her head, the moon's rays shined all the darkest moments, then it filled her with wonder.

Alice thanked the spirit for showing her how to do things better and she flew home, feeling brave and happy. Her mother smiled to see what Amelia had learned, knowing she'd be back to its old, distantland soon after.

“No, Amelia. You can’t","go higher than anything else in the sky."" Her mum replied, ""Don't worry, sweetie. I know you can do it!"" 

So, that night, Amelia set out on an adventure around the universe. It felt like no matter how hard we tried, nothing could stop her from succeeding.

When it started to get dark outside again, Amelia realised that this had ended for nothing. No matter how hard she searched for a long journey, she couldnâ€™t make it back home. With one last twist of wind, it became too cold and rainy. Suddenly, Amelia remembered something her mother always told her - if things seemed impossible, be brave and take one step at a time. So, Martha reached down and grabbed a handful of soft grass and some water from her garden.

Amelia swallowed the warmness in the air and took another big breath before returning into"
"Suddenly, the bunny heard a loud noise. It was a bird singing in the tree. The bunny wanted to see the bird, so he jumped","from its branches and tried to peek closer. But when it flew up high again, something caught his eye. He could hear someone talking nearby, but the voice said ""Share the time with me"". 
The bunny was confused, but he knew that he had to do as the bird asked. So he waited in front of the strange object and listened for it's special song. When the bird finished whistling, the bunny realized it must be coming back home! As soon as the bird appeared in the sky, the bunny hopped towards it. 
But just then, there was a terrible silence. A large bird was chasing them away - this time the bird wouldnâ€™t stop, no matter how much they insisted on getting close to him.

In this field there were lots of other animals like butterflies, squirrels and snails. They also spotted a little bird who was stuck in some bushes. He looked very upset, feeling scared and alone. 

The birds saw how the noise made them feel envious. So they quickly flew up and helped the bird. Together, they carried the bird back into their nest and everyone sang happy songs with them. Now they have a new friend!

They became best friends forever. And whenever they hear the same strange noise coming from the sky, they remember it and smile. It's nice that we all get along and make each other laugh! Everyone knows that even when things are disturbed and lonely, there is always someone else who can"

The bird answered again, then flapped its wings and flew away into the sky. But then it stopped and paused. There were two little white mice flying around! They looked very playful. 

Suddenly the bird started chirping happily, which made the bunny laugh and shout, ""Chew!"" Then, the bird came back and they became friends. Every day after that, the bunny would call out with its new friends to come visit them. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.

The End. So happy because today was special for both of us. We can be playful together forever - like we always do before.""  And that's how it happened. And every time one heard it, it reminded everyone about that good friend who loved each other so much. And, even if his name wasn"

The bird flew far away until finally it landed on a big rock. Then it said something very special: ""Climb onto my back"". So the bunny did as he was told and hopped across the grass. 
He felt warm and cozy on the rock, and decided to hop over there instead. As he got closer, the bunny could smell something yummy! He quickly ran towards it, but when he looked down, he saw that his feet were stuck in the rock! 
The bunny shouted for help. A little girl, who had been walking by, came running with her friend. She saw what happened and gently pulled out her little handlebar at the rock. She used the tool to lift them off and handed them to the bunny. 
The bunny thanked the little girl and hopped home happy. And from then on, whenever he"
"Ben hopped to the park, where he saw many kids playing. He looked around and saw a big, orange carrot hiding behind a tree. He hopped over to","it, curious about what kind of snack it was.

""Hello, kids,"" he said softly, ""can I have your orange carrot?""

The other kids turned around and looked at him with surprise. They laughed and pointed at their ears, but not for real. They knew that their eyes were shiny, but Ben's eyes didn't look like yellow or pink. They thought they were very silly and mean.

""You can't eat that,"" one kid lied. ""That is our fruits, and you are being rude.""

Ben felt sad and angry. He wanted to have the orange carrot as well, but he also loved his carrots. He tried to grab the orange carrot from the others, but they pushed him away.

""Hey, give it back!"" one of them yelled.

He ran towards them, hoping to scare them again."
"Ben hopped to the park, where he saw many kids playing. He looked around and saw a big, orange carrot hiding behind a tree. He hopped over to","see it up close, eager to try some of the tasty treats that someone had made.

He ran to the carrot and bit into it. But as soon as he did, a voice shouted from inside the car, ""Stop!"" It was a mean man who owned the store. The man was very angry at Ben for taking his food without asking him. The juice truck came back, but Ben knew it wasn't right for an important person to do.

He said sorry to the man and started to run away, still holding on to the carrot. Unfortunately, he was so tired that he almost fell down! But then something amazing happened: he met a special girl named Jane who was also looking for tasty snacks in her own garden. She offered to share her carrots with Ben. 

Ben smiled and thanked Jane. Together they enjoyed their juicy, orange carrot dinner. From then"
"Ben hopped to the park, where he saw many kids playing. He looked around and saw a big, orange carrot hiding behind a tree. He hopped over to","it, curious about what it was.

""What is that?"" he asked himself.

He picked up the carrot with his paws and started to sniff it. It smelled so good! He heard a giggle from inside the car. 

Ben put the carrot down, excited to see what was inside. But when he opened the door, there were no friends or surprises in there! There were bugs, squirrels, dogs and even a tiger. The carrots had grown bigger than Ben's paw and had become a giant tail. 

The tigers quickly jumped out of the way and chased after Ben and the carrot. Ben dropped the carrot back into his hands and ran away as fast as he could.

But the squirrel was faster and caught up with him before the bee jumped onto him. With one big push, Ben was able to escape and"
"Ben hopped to the park, where he saw many kids playing. He looked around and saw a big, orange carrot hiding behind a tree. He hopped over to","it, ready for a bite.

""Hello!"" said the white dog on the other side of the fence. ""Do you want some?""

Ben was surprised and curious. He nodded eagerly and poked his head through the bars. But there was no one around, so he decided not to know anyone else.

The dog came closer and sniffed at the peel. Then it started to eat it up! It made a funny noise, like a growl.

Ben felt embarrassed and jumped back. The dog wagged its tail and ran away with a grin.

He knew that if he had never asked before, he would have been lost in the bright sunshine. But he also remembered what happened when someone scolded him. He wished he could disappear. He smiled to himself as he walked home feeling embarrassed, but now knew it was time to tell Mum about the"
"His mom said yes, so they went to the toy store. Timmy saw a shiny red car that he really wanted, but it was too expensive. His mom said, ""We","can't get this car today, we have to find something else."" 

Timmy kept trying and looking around the toy store. Suddenly, he spotted one small toy he liked even more than his. He pointed at it and said ""I want that one!"" But when his mom asked him what she wanted, Timmy said, ""Please buy this one, I want that one!"" 

His mom shook her head and replied ""No, that toy is not enough for both of us"". She told Timmy he could pick out another small toy if he wanted. Timmy felt sad but he chose the same thing - he picked up a smaller toy instead of the old ones! 

They continued shopping until finally, Timmy found his favorite toy: the cheap car. It wasnâ€™t as much fun after all, but he was glad he decided to wait patiently to get what he wanted."
"His mom said yes, so they went to the toy store. Timmy saw a shiny red car that he really wanted, but it was too expensive. His mom said, ""We","can't buy it right now."" So instead they found some good cars that were cheap.

When Timmy and his mom returned home, she helped him put on the new cars. It fit perfectly on his bed! He hopped in the car and started driving around his house. 

He drove faster than ever before, feeling very happy with his new car. The car didn't fit anymore, because it had a special new garage. They played together for hours, taking turns zooming the car through the driveway and laughing. It was the best day ever!

When it was time for dinner, Timmy put his car away. He promised himself he would come back to the toy store and get another one soon. But he knew his mom would keep her promise.

And so, Timmy continued to have fun playing with his car, dreaming of the next time he could find an automobile available and making them do so."
"His mom said yes, so they went to the toy store. Timmy saw a shiny red car that he really wanted, but it was too expensive. His mom said, ""We","can't afford it now"". He felt sad.

Suddenly, his dad came over with an idea. He said they could buy it if they took turns! Timmy smiled and ran off with his parents holding her hand as they walked back home. 

Once they got there, Daddy asked why they were going to take the car together. Timmy replied, ""because at the toilet Mommy would make us pay for it!"" His dad laughed and said he didn't know what the problem was, but it sounded funny. 

They both put the car into their car and drove away in their cars. It was perfect! They made many happy memories after that day on that special toy. Every time they did something funny around, they always laughed and cheered. What a silly little boy it had been! 

The End. But even though Mom's car was cheap,"
"His mom said yes, so they went to the toy store. Timmy saw a shiny red car that he really wanted, but it was too expensive. His mom said, ""We","can't buy it right now. We have enough money.""

They left, and it started raining outside. Timmy had so much fun getting wet in his bathrobe. He loved to splash around in puddles with his red towel. 

But when it stopped raining, something bad happened. The water started pouring out of the bathtub! Timmy was very upset - he couldn't get inside his room and play there anymore. But then he remembered how sad he felt while holding his toast when his mom gave him the bathrobes. He smiled. He knew what she meant and thanked her for taking care of it. 

The end. Whenever Timmy got tired of playing and splashing, he would just come home. So whenever he opened his closet he remembered this special day. It wasn't important anymore; he liked it! And from that day on, he kept"

After the dog","ran away, they decided to take a walk in the park. As they walked, Lily saw some people with scissors. She asked her mommy why they were there. Her mommy told her that it was because she had brought them from home. They ran back home together. 

When they arrived home, her daddy was waiting for them. He said he was sorry he had run away too late and now his house was still empty. Then Lily heard something outside. It sounded like someone else's cries! She looked out the window and saw a little bird stuck inside an open hole near their house. Luckily, their mommy could help him get it out of the bird so he wouldn't have to worry anymore. 

Lily felt very happy that her mommy and daddy protected her. Now she was no longer scared of the scary thing outside. From then on, she always made sure to check for"

Lily cried out for help, and her mommy rushed outside to pick her up. She took Lily inside and gave her some water. They waited until Lily felt better and then went back outside to play with her friends again. From that day on, whenever Lily heard strange noises in town, she would remember the kind stranger who protected her from them. And she always remembered how brave she was when the mean man came by and protected her. The end. The end. They all agreed that being close means telling someone you love or what happens if we don't want to. It's always worth it to stay strong and brave in our lives.""

"Lily got scared and shouted, ""Mommy, protect me!"" Her mommy quickly picked her up and held her tightly. The dog barked loudly, but Lily's mommy kept her safe. 

After the dog","left, they started to walk in the park. Suddenly, a man came running towards them. He was looking for something special to make sure it was not dangerous or hurtful. 

Lily said, ""Mommy what is he looking for?"" Her mommy replied, ""He looks like we need to find him somewhere safe."" They both ran away as fast as their little legs could take them. 

Finally, after what felt like forever, they saw the man again. Lily was relieved to see that he had been caught by an unknown kind of gifts. Everyone clapped for him and Lily knew that nothing bad was happening now. Mommy was so proud of herself for protecting Lily from danger! It felt amazing - even though she still wasn't brave enough to come too far. What made it just easy when we first get back safely. Lily and her mommy were very happy.

"Lily got scared and shouted, ""Mommy, protect me!"" Her mommy quickly picked her up and held her tightly. The dog barked loudly, but Lily's mommy kept her safe. 

After the dog","left, they both felt better. They decided to explore a bit more of their neighborhood. Soon they reached the park where Lily was so excited! Everywhere she looked there were no dogs. Everything was dry! 

Suddenly Lily saw something that made her stop looking at it. It was an ice cream truck with lots of colourful vanilla-hippings inside. She pointed excitedly to the driver and asked what kind of treats he had in his truck. He told her for the delicious treats he had prepared for. 

Lily smiled with delight and said, ""Thank you mommy."" Mommy gave her a hug and kissed her forehead. Then they enjoyed their delicious treat together. Together, they enjoyed all the hot chocolate and the sunny day. What fun the delay made Lily feel! From then on, every time it rained, Lily would remember"
"Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big clock on a tower. The clock has a face and hands. It makes a loud sound every hour.

""Wow, look at the clock!"" Lily says. ""It is so big and cool!""

""Yes, it is!"" Tom says. ""Do you want to go closer and see it?""

Lily","shakes her head. She is afraid of the clock. She thinks the other clock might bite her or hurt her.

Tom picks up a stick and throws it at the clock. He wants to hit it hard. But he misses the time when the clock makes a loud noise.

The plane does not stop. It goes faster and faster. Then it falls off the tower. It hits the ground with a crash.

Everyone is scared and shocked. The people in the building get out. Some are crying and some are laughing.

Lily runs away from the wall. She feels sorry for what she did. She wishes she could save the day. She decides to be careful next time. Maybe then the clock will come back too. Or maybe someone else needs help. She hopes the jet will follow her someday. She holds Tom's hand and walks home. She still likes to play outside."

They walk slowly to the tower. They see the clock ticking and turning. Then it stops and the clock starts again.

""Hello, hello, who is there?"" a voice says from the clock. ""Where are you? I am your new friend!""

Lily and Tom scream. They jump back. They run away.

The clock makes another noise. It sounds like ""Come here"".

Lily and Tom hide behind some rocks. They peek out from the rocks. They hope the screen will stop ringing soon.

They peeked again. The clock keeps moving. Sometimes it goes off. Sometimes it goes around the same time.

Tom runs to help her. He sees that Lily is hurt. She has a cut on her knee. It bleeds and hurts a lot. She cries.

A man comes. He sees what happened. He is angry and worried. He takes Lily off the tower and takes her to the nurse. The nurse cleans Lily's wound and puts a band-aid on it. She gives them both some water and hugs.

She tells Tom and Lily that they should not climb the tower again without telling anyone. She says the tower was dangerous and not fun. She says they have to be careful and listen to her.

Tom and Lily say sorry. They learn their"
"Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big clock on a tower. The clock has a face and hands. It makes a loud sound every hour.

""Wow, look at the clock!"" Lily says. ""It is so big and cool!""

""Yes, it is!"" Tom says. ""Do you want to go closer and see it?""

Lily","nods. She thinks maybe she can touch the high numbers of the clock and make them move. She is not afraid of the time. She trusts Tom.

They hold hands and walk to the tower. They sit next to each other. Tom holds Lily's hand tightly. He tells her how brave he is. He tells her about the clock and the clock.

""I am proud of you,"" Lily says. ""You are my best friend.""

Tom smiles. He hugs Lily. He likes to teach his sister.

They hear a voice from below. It is their mom. She calls their names. She sounds worried and angry.

""What were you thinking?"" Mom asks. ""You know you should never climb such a tall building! You could fall or get hurt! Come here right now!""

Lily and Tom feel scared. They drop the clock. They run down"
"When Lily got home, she told her mom about the invitation. Her mom was happy for her but reminded her to be careful and listen to Lucy's parents. Lily promised to be a good listener.

The","next day, Lily and her family went on an adventure together in their backyard. As they looked up at the sky, something beautiful caught Lily's eye. It was the sunrise - sparkling brightly! 

She asked her mother, ""What is it? Is it magical?"" 

Her mother smiled and replied, ""Yes sweetie, it appears every year of all when we are awake and have lots of fun."" 

Lily was so excited she couldn't help but start skipping around the garden. They laughed and played until Lily started feeling uncomfortable. She didn't want the evening to end after all her wonderful memories with her special invitation, so she had to go inside without anyone noticing. 

So she said goodbye and waved as she walked away. Lily was already planning her next journey and would never forget her special invitation. Although she will"
"When Lily got home, she told her mom about the invitation. Her mom was happy for her but reminded her to be careful and listen to Lucy's parents. Lily promised to be a good listener.

The","next day, Lily went outside to play in the park. She saw two birds fighting over the swings while running around. She asked the other birds why they were fighting so soon. The bird explained that some people wanted to fight because it was dangerous.

Lily felt sad. She tried to help understand why the birds should not get to swing on their nests. But she didnâ€™t feel like being harmless after all! 

Afterwards, Lily remembered something important. Whenever anyone had a disagreement with ants, she could go to them and teach them how to be safe. This showed her the way to do the right thing. 

This story has an moral value: Be kind and thinkful. Donâ€™t fight and take unnecessary risks, or else you might end up losing friends! It is always better to think before you act! Being brave means doing something that doesnâ€™t mean"
"When Lily got home, she told her mom about the invitation. Her mom was happy for her but reminded her to be careful and listen to Lucy's parents. Lily promised to be a good listener.

The","next day when it rained, the sky became dark and gloomy. So Lily went back outside with her friend. They kept playing until they found an umbrella! It was bright yellow and had pictures of animals on it. 

Lily asked if they could borrow the umbrella so that they could stay dry even while it rains. Her friend agreed and Lily ran inside to get some paper and crayons. She then quickly came back into the house. 

They opened up the umbrella and used the shade to help keep their clothes safe from the rain. Then they ran back out and played together in the park again. Everyone laughed and smiled as they watched the two friends soak in the sunshine.

When it finally stopped raining, Lily said goodbye to her friend before heading inside. She knew she would always remember this special day as she followed the rain path behind them, without being too sc"
"When Lily got home, she told her mom about the invitation. Her mom was happy for her but reminded her to be careful and listen to Lucy's parents. Lily promised to be a good listener.

The","next day, Lily was playing with the best ball of them in town when another stranger appeared. He saw the other person and said he had no food or supplies. 

Lily felt helpless that the stranger wasn't able to supply something yummy. She quickly remembered what her mother said - don't let anyone spoil their fun without helping someone else first. 

So Lily thought carefully and finally came up with an idea. She went out into the neighbourhood asking if they could help make enough food. The two people were delighted to do this because Lily knew how to use the money they needed.

Soon, everyone was buying food from the store. By using the money, they supplied more than just one person. In the end, everyone was very thankful for Lily and her quick thinking to save dinner at the same time. 

Itâ€™s important to always help others! Luckily,"
"""I want this one,"" she said.

""Okay, sweetie,"" said her mom.

Then, Lily saw a magician at another table. He made a coin vanish from his hand. Lily was amazed and wanted to see more. She went up to the magician and","asked if he could teach her how to make things disappear. The magician smiled and said yes. 

He taught Lily how to take off some spooky clothes with sparkles. Then he gave her some candy and told her to come back tomorrow for her medicine. 

Lily thanked the magician and ran away with her penny. Now she knew all about magic! From that day forward, Lily always kept an eye out for mysterious magical days ahead. 

She soon realized what was real: if something doesn't go anywhere, it is probably only magical! And even though it looks like fun, it doesn't really matter - what matters is how you use your imagination and be creative. 

From then onwards, whenever Lily needed to find something, she would simply sit down in her special chair and have some magical moments. It will bring such happiness and adventures that she can"
"""I want this one,"" she said.

""Okay, sweetie,"" said her mom.

Then, Lily saw a magician at another table. He made a coin vanish from his hand. Lily was amazed and wanted to see more. She went up to the magician and","asked him where he had been.

""It's my magic tricker!"" he said with a smile. ""I make things disappear when I turn them in reverse.""

Lily laughed and ran back to her mom. But when they got there, it was already gone! They looked everywhere but couldn't find it. The magician had taken away their fun and made something normal again. 

Lily was very sad and cried all night. She didn't want her mysterious trick anymore. From that day on, she never trusted anyone who would be so mean to her. The end. The end. The story ended in unison, but Lily never forgot the special moment she spent on her time with the magician. Her magic trick was gone forever. The end. The end. And now, nothing is ever fair for anything else. It was just ordinary, but it did work out with the magic of the magicians. Sometimes,"
"""I want this one,"" she said.

""Okay, sweetie,"" said her mom.

Then, Lily saw a magician at another table. He made a coin vanish from his hand. Lily was amazed and wanted to see more. She went up to the magician and","asked if he could show her how he used the coin in reverseing it. 

The magician smiled and took out some candy. It was very tasty! The frozen treats were soft and crunchy too. 

Lily started eating the candy and soon began to feel better. She thanked the magician and then went back home with her mommy's delicious surprise. From that day onwards, every time they had ice cream, the magicians would bring a special gift for Lily. It was like the magician did something extra special, just for her. 

It was her very own special day indeed! And ever since, whenever Lily smiles at the magician, because she knows what happened to him doing all the way through magic. What an incredible adventure they had together.  The End. With this tasty treat, Lily never forgot what happened when she realized"
"""I want this one,"" she said.

""Okay, sweetie,"" said her mom.

Then, Lily saw a magician at another table. He made a coin vanish from his hand. Lily was amazed and wanted to see more. She went up to the magician and","asked him how he did it.

""He made a wish and then let me make a wish."" the magician said.

Lily smiled. The magician gave her some clues.

""Wow, you are very creative!"" said Lily.

The magician nodded. He moved his hands around in circles and pointed them into the air. Lily clapped with excitement as she watched. 

When he was done, he smiled again and disappeared behind the fence. Lily thought it was the most wonderful thing she had ever seen. 

She ran over to her mom and hugged her tightly.

""Mommy, I can't wait to tell my friends what we learned,"" she exclaimed.

Her mother laughed and kissed her forehead.

""That would be awesome!"" she replied.

And so they went off to show all of their friends their discovery"
"Ben and Lily were kids who liked to play outside. They had a big yard with a swing, a slide and a sandbox. They also had a dog named Max, who was very friendly and reliable. Max always stayed with them and protected them from anything scary.

One day, Ben and Lily decided to play a game of hide and","seek. Ben was the seeker and Lily was the hider. She ran behind the tree and hid in the bushes. Ben looked for her everywhere but he could not find her. He started to feel sad and worried that she would disappear.

Lily heard Ben's squeak and followed his nose to the grass. She saw him getting ready to surprise her. She came out from behind the tree and smiled. ""I found you!"" she said.

Ben jumped out and shouted, ""You are it! I win!"" But then he frowned and said, ""You are too good at hiding, Max! You are so fast!""

He picked up Lily and gave her a hug. Then they laughed together and continued their game of tag. Mom watched them from the porch and felt happy and proud of her clever children. She knew they loved animals and that made them happy too. The end. The sun"

One day, Ben and Lily decided to play a game of hide and","seek with Max. They each took turns looking for the best hiding spots in their garden. Ben counted to ten while Lily ran to find a good spot. She saw a bush with bright red flowers and thought they might be inside. She lifted her foot and crawled under it.

""Boo!"" she yelled as Max sneezed in fear. She had found him! She pulled his tail and grabbed her breathing stick. But then she saw something that made her stop crying. A bird had flown into the garden where Lily hid too long. The bird was looking for Ben. It flew around them, making loud noises.

""Max!"" Ben shouted when he heard what happened. ""You missed me!""

Lily laughed. She didn't care about Max. He was just trying to protect them. She loved Max and hugged him tightly. She told him he was a dependable k"

One day, Ben and Lily decided to play a game of hide and","seek in the house next door. Ben said, ""I will count to ten and you go find me. Then I will be there again."" He ran upstairs and looked for his favorite hiding spot behind the couch. He found him right away and smiled at him. He put his hands on Max's back and waited for him to come closer.

Lily finished counting and came out of her hiding place. She saw that she had hidden under some hay. She was very surprised and worried. She called out, ""Max! Where are you? Come out now!"" Max heard her voice and followed her. He knew he was behind a gate that led to the garden. He barked happily and jumped on his way back to her side.

Ben heard Max's sound and turned around. He was glad that they both came out safely. He said, ""Good job, kids! You did it! That was amazing! What"

One day, Ben and Lily decided to play a game of hide and","seek behind the fence. They took turns hiding and seeking each other. Who could find a good spot first? A clue where Max hid a bone under the fence. If they found his bone, he would be sad or hungry. But if he did, they would have to go home soon.

Ben and Lily ran around the yard, calling and finding a new hiding spot. They saw Max sleeping on the porch, snoring softly in his bed. He looked cozy and calm. They thought maybe Max could help them look for him later. They heard some noises from upstairs, like chirping birds and cats. It sounded funny.

They got closer to the porch and peeked over the fence. They saw Max hiding behind a shelf, wagging his tail. He was smiling and holding something in his mouth. Ben and Lily reached their hands inside and pulled out"
"Later, Tim saw a hairy dog in the park. The dog was big and friendly. Tim played with the dog and they had a lot of fun. But, when Tim","went home he forgot to close the gate that led to the dog's yard.

The next day, the hairy dog returned. It was playing near the yard again! Tim remembered what happened at the park the week before. He ran outside and said hello to the dog. The dog wagged its tail and barked happily. They played together all afternoon until it was time for dinner. From then on, Tim always made sure to lock his door to the yard so his new friend could play there too. The end. The dog became their best friend and they would have lots of laughs and smile every day. The End. The end. Wearing a promise last lives for the moral of the story. And a great new friend can come along any time you need to be welcomed by someone who loves animals just as much as they are. So never forget your promise or keep reminding me to make a good decision!â€™ "
"Later, Tim saw a hairy dog in the park. The dog was big and friendly. Tim played with the dog and they had a lot of fun. But, when Tim","went home, he forgot to take off his coat and it got stuck on his legs! He could not play with the dog anymore.

Tim's mom said she would help him find something that helps fix his coat. They looked all around the house but couldn't find what happened. Then, Mom remembered seeing a comb on the floor. She quickly grabbed it and cleaned the bear's tail. Now Tim's coat was fixed and he could wear it again!

From then on, Tim never forgot to bring his special things to school. Whenever he wore them or needed a haircut, he knew just how to tie them! That way, he wouldn't have a bad ending like the hairy dog did for him before. The end. Tim loved wearing his favorite things and feeling proud of himself for being brave enough to give this chance. And the mess he made! The end. The end. Poor Tim! But"
"Later, Tim saw a hairy dog in the park. The dog was big and friendly. Tim played with the dog and they had a lot of fun. But, when Tim","left the park he felt sad because his new friend was gone.

A nice lady found the hairy dog by her house. She looked for him everywhere. Tim's mom asked a man if she could find the dog. They searched together, but the dog ran away to another yard.

After some time, they heard a bark from behind a bush. A kind girl took out the toy dog and gave it back to Tim. He was so happy! Tim thanked the girl and promised to always protect his new friend from trouble. From that day on, they became good friends who played in the park every day. And the hairy dog would always come to play too. The end. The end. The end.

The moral of the story is that sometimes people can go different ways or try to help our friends. It's important to remember to stay safe and look out for them. When we follow our instincts, like the cat with long"
"Later, Tim saw a hairy dog in the park. The dog was big and friendly. Tim played with the dog and they had a lot of fun. But, when Tim","left the park, the dog came closer to him.

Tim did not know that the hairy dog could talk! As soon as he touched the dog, it started to bark very loudly. Tim's mom heard the noise and came running to see what was happening. She told Tim not to touch strange dogs because bad dogs can hurt people.

The next day at the park, there were no more bad dogs around. Instead, Tim and his mom went home after playing together. Tim learned that some things are better to look out for than one person touch. He knew he should listen to the difference between good and kind animals. And from that day on, Tim made sure to always point out nice friends whenever he met new ones. That way, everyone would be safe and happy.

The moral of the story is: Always respect others' differences if you want them to. If Tim faced a problem or tried to stop something bad, he might feel ashamed"
"Once upon a time there was a small village by the sea with a beautiful bell tower. Every day the bell would ring to tell the people it was time for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

One day, the village was in trouble. A huge flood had come in during","the night and all of the villagers were scared. Suddenly, they heard a sound that made them very frightened. It came from deep inside the village. 

The village workers quickly ran up the stairs and called out the loudest noise of all. All of the villagers began running away but one brave person bravely went down the slippery stones near the castle walls. 

The warrior took a big deep breath and spoke with everyone else: ""We must always protect each other, no matter how bad things happen"". The brave person left in terror as they all held hands and headed off into the distance. 

From this experience, the villagers remembered the power of their town being protected by some kindness and courageous words. They vowed never to forget their brave actions of saving themselves from the floods. That's why we must remain brave no matter what happened!â€ From then onward, all"

One day, the village was in trouble. A huge flood had come in during","its crash and all of their houses were very wet. The villagers quickly got together to help to keep everyone safe and dry until everything was alright again.

Once they reached home, they put up flags on the windows and knocked down some cables. They were so happy that they started dancing and singing around the room! 

The village was sad when the flood came back, but they knew it was over before they could make another one and still have enough energy for the rest of their lives. They smiled at each other and hugged in happiness once more knowing how important it is to take care of your home. And even though life is often a bit rough sometimes, the village will always be alive from a way to be surrounded by love and family. This taught them the importance of taking responsibility for our actions and never giving up, no matter how big the task may be!  From then on, everyone living happily ever after!

One day, the village was in trouble. A huge flood had come in during","their home and destroyed everything around it. The people were very scared and didn't know what to do. But then something amazing happened! 

The village ran to the nearest lake where they could get out of the water without getting wetter. As they all worked together to put on their raincoats and hats, they noticed that the lake still looked like an earthquake. Soon, it stopped shaking and was quiet once more.

Soon the sun rose and the village started to feel better than ever before. Everyone was so happy and thankful that nobody got hurt when it was gone. Now that the lake was back to being solid no matter how far away it took them, the village stayed strong and graceful thanks to the magical ice.

And that is how the forest remains alive again one day after it lasts forever. Everything that needs the best help is always a good deed. And if you need the help"

But then something wonderful happened! Suddenly, everything changed: a bright light rose up from the water's rays! It came down quickly and everyone gasped with delight.

They all cheered when the door opened. To their surprise, out of the flooding the entire village was made by a group of friendly birds! Everyone smiled happily and enjoyed eating delicious food at the party. 

The singing birds kept making them smile until late into the evening. They said goodbye, and thank you to each other before sending off on their merry way. And so the villagers' music filled the village every morning. What an amazing sight that they will never forget!  The end. 

Everything looked very pale and empty as a special sign. But at least the birds flew away -"
"Frankie was a clever boy. He wanted to play some sport.

He found a ball and decided to throw it. He held the ball firmly in both of his hands and threw it up, high","into the air! It went flying across the room and splashed down from the wall! 

Frankie couldn't believe his eyes! The ball flew higher than he had ever been before and he laughed out loud as it flew around.

Then Frankie picked it up and put it back on the ceiling where he could keep playing with it. He ran over and grabbed another ball. This time, he threw it even further! And this time the other one flew right into Frankie's hand - it landed onto the floor behind him and he couldn't believe it!

""You're really clever for throwing things like that!"" said a voice coming from underneath his mom, who had watched everything intently. ""Be careful next time, or else you might make your feet hurt.""

So Frankie thanked the person who left him alone and decided to go find a better sport. With much more ca"

Frankie smiled happily. He felt so good that he couldn't stop smiling. The other players laughed too.

Frankie kept throwing the ball until there were none left for him to kick. Then he ran off to play some more games with his family. His mom had been watching from afar, but Frankie knew something fun was going to happen next time. 

The next day, he went back to the park and saw something amazing. A new game he had never seen before - lots of people gathered to watch a unique sport competition! 

Even though Frankie didn't win the prize, he was still glad he had played sports like this. It made him feel really special.

Frankie watched as the ball got further away from him. Then he jumped back onto his knees and caught it.

Even when he threw it back again, another one would disappear around the corner. But this time there were lots more goals on its own!

Frankie kept throwing the ball until he got tired. Suddenly, a friendly old man appeared beside him. The old man smiled at Frankie with admiration and thanked him for catching such an amazing skill before passing by the ball. 

Frankie felt proud and happy that he had been able to make something special. Now he could take his new sport everywhere he went and show everyone how clever he was! And they all lived happily ever after.

But then he dropped it, over the grass. The ball rolled across to a pond. Frankie wanted to get the ball. He thought that if only he could get to the water.

So Frankie walked carefully to the edge of the pond. But when he reached the edge, the ball started getting closer and close to the surface!

Frankie watched sadly as his ball slipped out of the water and floated away. He knew he had lost it forever. But the next day Frankie looked for his stick, hoping he would find his cool, yellow ball again. Sure enough, just as he was about to give up hope, a bigger surprise appeared on the shore - his stick perched atop a bush right there! 

Frankie laughed with delight and ran home to show his parents what happened. From then on,"
"Once upon a time, there was a cute clown who lived in the circus. He was always so happy and smiled all the time. The clown loved to make people laugh.

One day, the clown was feeling really tired and decided to take a nap. He went to his","sleeping spot by himself, but when he woke up, everything looked different. Everyone was laughing at him! The clown felt embarrassed. 

Then, something magical happened. A little girl came to visit the clown. She asked the clown if she could help him feel better. The clown said yes.

The girl took the clown's hand and they both closed their eyes together, thinking of what else the suit would be like. Eventually, the clown fell asleep again and when they awoke, they were back to playing with laughter. 

From then on, whenever the clown felt embarrassed or sad, he remembered that his friend the clown made the best of it. And even though the clown couldnâ€™t play with anyone because he was still a clown. But, no matter how much he thought about"

The clown had so much fun that he forgot how tired he was before. When night fell, he snuggled up in his comfy chair and rested until he could feel warm again. 

And from then on, everytime the clown came back to the circus, everyone would stop by to give him treats and they laughed at the clown's silly jokes. This made them smile and laugh too!

The clown thought for a moment before deciding what to do. With one powerful spring-pip, he rose high above the stage and got ready to release the balloon-pizzle. But before he could, a bird swooped down from the sky, grabbed the clown's hand with its beak and lifted him off the branch.

"Lily didn't know what ""yield"" meant, but her friend explained it meant to let go and let good things happen. So, Lily decided to yield to her","friends when they asked for something special.

One day she went out to buy some yummy treats. She found the most delicious food and bought them all with a big smile on her face. Her friends were so excited when she gave them the treat - even though they had expected it to be too expensive! 

Lily was relieved that she hadnâ€™t given enough money to give away and made sure that her friends were happy in their days. Everyone thanked her for finding such kindness and generosity. That night, as Lily drifted off to sleep, she thought about how much she could share this moment with her friends. The importance of giving away her best behavior can make the world an ordinary life more special.

The moral of the story is: never surrender or return without permission first â€“ sometimes unexpected results are possible. A simple gesture should bring joy, rather than by simply trying to offer it to others"

Her brother was amazed at how smart and helpful Lily was. They continued walking through the forest together, feeling happy and grateful for each other's company. From that day on, Lily knew that even though there were many things that are too expensive to be sold down from her life, she could still find joy with her own family and friends.

"Lily didn't know what ""yield"" meant, but her friend explained it meant to let go and let good things happen. So, Lily decided to yield to her","friend the fact that she can help keep her healthy by eating a big breakfast.

Later that day, Lily went to play with her friends at the park. They were having so much fun playing on the swings, slides and climbs. But suddenly, one of Lily's friends accidentally broke one of the bars while they were swinging. They didn't pay attention anymore and couldn't breathe well enough.

Lily remembered the word ""reverse"" sign from her other friend and knew it was important to keep them away from their skin! She quickly grabbed her friend and told him not to worry as long as he would take care of herself. Her friend felt better and thanked Lily for being such a reliable friend who always kept the rules. From then on, whenever something bad happened, Lily knew she could always count on her friend to be there for her. The end. The end.

"Lily didn't know what ""yield"" meant, but her friend explained it meant to let go and let good things happen. So, Lily decided to yield to her","friend and walk away from her home in the big city.

As she was walking, Lily felt something funny in her stomach. She looked down and saw that her lungs were getting cold! She realized that sometimes you can do amazing things if you try and understand them first before crossing up to your home.

Lily learned an important lesson that day. She learned that sometimes things might seem scary or unfamiliar at first, but with some patience and safety, anything is possible. And when she got there on time, she knew she could always go back to her friends and family to help them feel safe and happy. The end. 

From then on, Lily made sure to pay attention to her surroundings of her town while going out for a few days. And whenever something seemed too hard to resist, her friends would remind her how much they loved her. She learned that even small acts of kindness can"
"Once there was a young girl named Sarah. Sarah was three years old. She always wanted to help her dad when he was cleaning around the house. One day, Sarah decided to search for a rag to clean with. She searched around the entire house for a rag but","she couldn't find one that was just any old and worn out of the dryer.

Sarah started looking all over for the perfect rag. Finally, after searching around the kitchen cupboard, she found it in the bathroom! She quickly took it outside and ran back to her dad. He saw her with his special rag and said ""Oh my little one!"" 

After that Sarah went to her Daddy and asked if she could give him something else so she got him a book about pistols! Her Daddy smiled and gave her a hug. Then they both laughed and Sarah hugged him even tighter. It was like the happy moment she felt while searching for the missing dirty rag! And from then on, Sarah made sure her Dad had lots of fun paces with her favorite items. 

The end. But Timmy and Sarah were very happy because they had worked together enough to save the cloth - thanks to"

Suddenly she heard her mom call from downstairs and asked if they could go upstairs. As Sarah walked upstairs, she noticed the same rag as her dad. It was lying on the floor under an old chair! She quickly picked it up and gave it back to her dad.

Her dad smiled and said: ""Thank you, Sarah."" He then took the rag and went away, leaving his work tidy again. Sarah watched him until he disappeared over the horizon, happy that her Dad was now ready to take care of himself. From that moment onward, whenever Sarah felt confused, she would just use her rag - like her Daddy was helping her with her mission to look after herself. She also learned to be brave and not to give up no matter how big or small things are, as long as you keep looking forward to completing anything.  Her Dad continued"

She searched around the entire house for a rag but","she couldn't find one that looked nice and clean enough. Suddenly, Sarah spotted a rag lying on the floor outside!

""Daddy!"" exclaimed Sarah excitedly. Her Daddy ran outside to see what Sarah had found and saw the rag. He told Sarah it was very dirty and needed to be put away so the cloth could sparkle like the rag did before it started to get too dirty. 

Sarah was determined to do something about it. ""I know,"" she said, ""it will look great if we're both cleaning this rag together!"" So the two of them got out the bucket and wiped away all the mud from each other. After that, they worked hard until the rag was sparkling shining again. 

When their work was done, Sarah showed Daddy how happy the rag looked after they were done it. From then on, Sarah made sure to keep an eye on clean rag when she"

Sarah went out on her walk and saw a rag in a garden. She picked it up and ran back home with it. When she got inside, her dad was so proud of her! He put away all his work and hugged Sarah. They spent some time together helping the neighbours clean their house. Everyone said they had succeeded because of Sarahâ€™s loyalty to help. 

The end. The family was happy that Sarah showed them how important she could be and how grateful she was for each otherâ€™s support. Even though she looked around, she knew that one thing she needed to do was work hard with others to make them smile too. The family enjoyed spending time with each other and promised to take care of Sarah no matter what. 

Since then, Sarah has been doing lots of fun things as long as she can look after herself and to everyone else â€"
"Lilly showed her friend, Tim. ""Look at this powder I found,"" she said. ""Let's play with it!"" So, they put the powder on their hands and threw it in the air. It looked like colorful rain.

But","then, something funny happened. The powder got stuck on their feet! They tried to pull it off, but it wouldn't move. ""Ouch! That hurts!"" cried Lilly.

Then, a nice lady saw them and came over. She took out some spicy chips from her bag and gave one half to Lilly. ""Be careful now."" she said. 

Lilly and Tim thanked the lady for being so kind. Then, the nice lady helped them take the sprinkles off their feet. After that, Lilly and Tim continued playing with the powder. But not too fast or too long, because the powder was harsh. Instead, Lilly suggested they pick up any leaves they found and scatter them somewhere. Soon, all three were scattering the leaves across the park. Everyone was happy again. 

The end. From then on, Lilly and Tim played together safely when it"
"Lilly showed her friend, Tim. ""Look at this powder I found,"" she said. ""Let's play with it!"" So, they put the powder on their hands and threw it in the air. It looked like colorful rain.

But","then something bad happened. The powder went too far away from them and disappeared into the woods! They were very sad and didn't know what to do. ""Where did the powder go?"" asked Lilly. ""I don't know,"" said Tim. ""Maybe it's gone forever.""

They looked for the powder everywhere but couldn't find it. Just when they thought they would never see it again, they heard a voice say, ""Don't worry, I saw the powder disappear behind that big tree over there!"" When they turned around to see who it was, they saw a squirrel playing a game of hide-and-seek in the tree. They laughed as they watched the squirrel chase after it until it disappeared back into the trees. From that day on, they always remembered to be careful and look up before making decisions. And the conflict is resolved, just a little less. The end. "
"Lilly showed her friend, Tim. ""Look at this powder I found,"" she said. ""Let's play with it!"" So, they put the powder on their hands and threw it in the air. It looked like colorful rain.

But","then, Lilly threw the powder too far and it flew away. She was sad and started to cry. Tim tried to help her but they couldn't find it either. They were both very sorry for losing the powder. Now they had nothing to play with. And that made them even more sad. The end.

The end. The story ended when Lilly and Tim felt guilty, they knew they should not have played so much with the powder anymore. If they could not have been more careful, they would lose all of their fun days together. This taught everyone a valuable lesson: never be too bossy and always think about safety first. From then on, Lilly learned to look carefully before throwing things near each other. In order to stay safe is an important part of life. 

Moral: Respect nature and its importance - even if it looks pretty! Even though you might regret it or lose something that we can miss"
"Lilly showed her friend, Tim. ""Look at this powder I found,"" she said. ""Let's play with it!"" So, they put the powder on their hands and threw it in the air. It looked like colorful rain.

But","then something happened! The powder flew up to a tree branch and fell to the ground! They were both shocked. Lilly started laughing at Tim because she thought he was being stupid. She explained that it had been magic and would come back soon. 

Tim laughed too, but he still didnâ€™t believe her. He knew how special Lilly was and how much fun he could have playing with his powder. Soon the sun set and it got dark. But, they knew one thing - when you are angry, they will always have the best time playing together with something magical.

So from that day forward, the two friends never stopped talking about magical things as long as they knew what was possible â€“ in life, love and joy. With friendship, nothing ever made them stop thinking of each other. And every night they tucked away into bed, remembering the wonderful memory of making a promise.

"Lily didn't want to watch her baby brother because she thought he was stupid and didn't want to play with him. But her mommy said she had to watch him and left.

After","a while, Lily got bored of watching the silly monkey bars in front of her house. She sat down on the couch next to her bed and closed her eyes, thinking about all the fun things they could do together. Suddenly, her brother woke up from his nap and started playing with her favorite doll.

Lily giggled and joined in on the joke. They played for hours until it was time for dinner. When Lily took out the plate from the refrigerator, she saw that the food she had turned out to be still and looked delicious. Her daddy came home and enjoyed the meal with everyone. From then on, Lily wasn't so stupid anymore when her parents bought her special gadget. The end. 

The moral of the story is that even if you don't love someone or anything else, you can still have fun and enjoy life with them. And that's"
"Lily didn't want to watch her baby brother because she thought he was stupid and didn't want to play with him. But her mommy said she had to watch him and left.

After","a while, the baby started crying and his sister came over to see what happened. She saw that Lily looked sad and wanted to make things better for her little brother. So she gave him a big hug and they played together nicely. 

Later that day, Lily showed her mommy how much she loved him and promised herself to always try to be kinder around her brother from now on. They both sat down and enjoyed their snacks together before going back to bed. From then on, Lily made sure to always help whenever her family needed it, but also remembered to let people know when you were feeling upset or scared. And by watching her favorite show, everyone else was happy. The end. The end.

Moral of the story: It is important to be helpful, do other things too than just wanting something like TV all for yourself. When we include others in our work, we can make a difference and be proud of"
"Lily didn't want to watch her baby brother because she thought he was stupid and didn't want to play with him. But her mommy said she had to watch him and left.

After","they finished watching, Lily asked her mommy if she could put a flower on the crib for her brother to look at too. Her mommy agreed and gave her a shiny paper to draw on.

Later that day, when her daddy came home from work, they all sat down to have dinner together. When their food arrived, Lily saw the beautiful bouquet of flowers and felt proud to be able to help her family. She knew it was important to take care of our body and share with others so everyone can enjoy its beauty. 

From then on, Lily tried not to force her parents by putting things out as a way to show them how much she cared. And whenever something went wrong, she remembered the importance of being kind and responsible. The end. From that day on, Lily learned that having fun with someone was worth more than just drawing pictures. And in the end, all her family members were happy. The end"

After","a while, Lily got bored and went to the park with her daddy. She saw a big red ball that seemed like fun. ""Daddy, can I have a turn?"" she asked. Her daddy smiled and let her hold the ball.

Lily played with the ball for a long time and had so much fun. When it was time to go home, she hugged her daddy and said, ""I love you, Daddy."" He hugged her back and they walked home together. From then on, whenever they watched TV, Lily knew her daddy would be there waiting for her and make her happy. The end. The moral of the story is to not judge someone by how they look or what they wear. Sometimes things may seem small but hard, like being able to run around and roll over. And sometimes your little brother might think something doesn't fit just as good. But if you try your best, you might"

Finally the girl found a magical park that she enjoyed many years ago. It was full of flowers, birds singing songs and lots of life were growing around the corner. The girl felt so lucky to finally have such wonderful memories inside of her.

She sat down by the shore of the lake and started making friends with some people nearby. After a few weeks, the people noticed the beautiful sounds of the water and welcomed the little girl with open arms. They all knew that her wish had been granted!

The little girl stayed at the lake for many days, just enjoying the wonderful feeling. With their newfound courage they had found something special; something available that only they could explore. And then eventually, the sun set and night became brighter than ever before.

He swam through the deep blue sea until he found a big, juicy worm. He quickly tried it but it was too sour! All the other fish laughed at him because he couldn't eat it.

Then, suddenly, one of his fish friends appeared from behind a rock. She said: ""It is best if you don't eat this worm, why don't we all take turns?""

Fred answered nervously, â€œIâ€™m trying on this delicious salty seaweed to try and eat that! Please don't be mad. We shouldn't do that - why would you make us angry?""

One day,","Fred heard some loud noises coming from his cave up ahead. When he looked inside he saw something shiny and exciting - it was an oyster! It was so pretty and mysterious that Fred couldn't believe his eyes. He swam closer to take a better look, when suddenly he started to cry out in pain. 

He realized he didn't know who it belonged to and it made him feel even worse. The oyster then revealed its secrets â€“ they were all living creatures in the sea! All their clumsy little babies were too afraid to stay still, but they werenâ€™t afraid yet - they just wanted to explore more!

Fred felt bad for scaring them, so he decided to help by sharing his stories about being kind. The two kids learned quickly and soon they were both enjoying listening to each otherâ€™s stories.

One day,","Fred noticed that all his fish friends were eating some delicious food. They asked him to join them for lunch and swim together. But it was so cold that the sea was icy!

Fred thought about what he should do - if he would be able to help out his friends, he could make sure they didn't suffer from it anymore. So, Fred worked hard, and soon enough he had made it across the icy waters to eat the sandwiches. All the fish were happy and thanked him for making their lives easier. From then on, Fred helped everyone whenever they needed something.

"Once upon a time, there was a pink elephant. His name was Donald. He loved playing with his friends in the savannah. But one day, he did something wrong. He picked flowers from a bush and his friends were","very sad.

He felt bad about what he had done and wanted to make it better. So he decided to reverse what he said! He made an invitation so that everyone would know how important that they can be. 

Dan smiled as his friend started walking away but soon realized why. One of his friends had changed his mind. That meant that if everyone reversed things correctly, everyone should have respected their decision - even if it wasn't yours.

Terrened his head aloud, his friend told him: ""It's ok, my friend. I don't really mean to upset you."" 

Donald felt much better after his friend explained this, and was able to continue to bring peace when anyone was trying to change his behaviour. The moral of the story is that honesty and kindness are always the best way to help other people understand life's feelings. Being serious is not enough; being gentle and kind,"
"Once upon a time, there was a pink elephant. His name was Donald. He loved playing with his friends in the savannah. But one day, he did something wrong. He picked flowers from a bush and his friends were","sad. They knew they had to forgive him.

So they went upstairs and asked all their other animal friends for help. Everyone got together and told stories and sang songs until everyone felt better. Then it happened! Someone started picking all the flower petals that lay near the roses. 

Everyone was so happy. After that, Donald learned a lesson: always forgive and be kind to others. That way people will always be nice to each other. That's why we should forgive! 

And thus, when things hurt you, can turn into happiness again!"" Everyone smiled at their broken fences and sat down to read a book underneath them. And ever since then, Arnold and his friends remember to forgive each other whenever they have a bad ending. The End.

They asked him why he had done it, but he just ignored them. He continued to play by himself in the forest. 

Then, his friend spoke up. ""What is it? Why don't you like these beautiful flower plants?"" asked his friend.

Donald thought about it for a while. Then, he realized that he must not have forgotten anything. So, he decided to take a few of the petals back home. 

That night, Donald remembered what his friend said and put the flower plant aside for another new adventure in the future. This story teaches us an important lesson: no matter who we are, all it takes is learning how to be kind and respectful into the things we do not want anymore. That way, we can make the world a better place and live happily ever after. The end.

Donald's friend said, ""Why did you pick them? We weren't paying it on time!"" 
But Donald replied, ""I wanted to see what would happen if I dropped my flowers."" 
So Rod picked up each flower carefully. When he looked at them again, he saw that they had scattered all over the place.

Donald knew he had done something bad by throwing away their flowers so soon it wouldnâ€™t be able to hang in the most beautiful landscape of them! 
Dan promised his friends never to do such a thing like this again. And that is how he learnt an important lesson about following instructions. The end.

Then, their big sister came into the room. She saw what happened and had an idea. She took some tape and fixed all the pages of the diary. Now it wasn't messy anymore. Sue and Tim were happy, and they played together again with their toys and books. The moral of the story is: don't give up because you can find a way to fix things if they make things better.

Ruby was sad, but then she remembered her mom had said that she could always go back home if needed. So, with a smile, she turned around and zoomed back home, never looking back. 

When she got home, the house was full of life and love once again. The sparks made the room look so much brighter. And ever since that day, Ruby remembers to take care of the things we have and bring them closer to our homes. No matter what happens - there is still hope and joy in this world!"".

He then dropped Ruby's hand into the cool water. Her mum smiled and told her ""This looks like you should not have gone too far,"" but Ruby didn't listen and started swimming.

"Once upon a time there lived a small girl named Emma. Everyday Emma used to go outside and play in the garden. One day, she realized that the ground in her garden was too hard and not comfortable to play on.

So Emma decided to go inside","and find a solution. She looked around for something she could use instead of the grass. After searching through her kitchen cupboards, she found an old wooden chair and put it beside one of the stairs she had taken earlier. 

Emma thought this would be perfect and quickly began to move furniture from all around the room to make its original spot better. As she moved, she saw a few things getting tangled up or tucked away. But still, she managed to get rid of them by being persistent.

So Emma decided to go inside","her house and ask her mom for help. Her mom had an idea and showed her how to fix it! 

The next morning, Emmaâ€™s mom took her outside into their backyard where there were some rocks in the soil with some dirt on them so they could be comfortable. She told Emma to keep going and find more rocks around the garden.

Emma found so many new pieces of leaves that she put all over the roots and grass. Soon the yard was full of colorful stones. The logs looked fit and strong as the sun set.

Emmaâ€™s mom gave her another hand to look at her work. Then, Emma carefully filled the path back up the shed. Now everything was nice and secure. It felt like she belonged there again. 

And from then on, whenever Emma needed something special, she would take a few steps away. Together, they enjoyed exploring the garden, finding new things"

Her mom said yes and they went into the store together to get the best lotion for Emma's hands. At last, they chose a bottle of lotion and filled up the kitchen with delicious smelling sweet tea.

Emma enjoyed her new special kind of tea and ate it up very quickly! After that day, Emma was never out of making funny faces while drinking her special tea at noon. The end.

At the zoo, Alex saw tigers,","elephants, monkeys, and even giraffes! But today, something different happened; something caught his eye in an enchanted cave. It seemed like it had magical powers. His eyes sparkled and he couldn't stop looking into its mysterious cave.

He asked his mum if they could go inside, but she said no, as she told him not to because it might make them very upset.

His dad explained that the giraffes were much smaller than one thing in the whole zoo, and they had to stay far away from him.

Alex watched some of the other animals for what felt like ages. Suddenly he heard something very loud coming from the next exhibit.

At the zoo, Alex saw tigers,","giraffes, lions and elephants. But what he wanted most of all was the big puddle! The water in the zoo had become murky and wet from all that was happening. As Alex watched, he noticed something else strange. All around him were rocks of different colors! They looked like they could change color when it came out of the water. 

Alex was very curious, so he asked his parents why this happened. His father explained that some rocks have fallen apart and he didn't know how long they can come back together again. Alex thought hard about what kind of problems the river had done before. Eventually, he decided to give it another try. Soon enough the rocks returned, but this time he found the same shiny rock at the end of the rainbow water. It seemed like an example for them!

Then Lisa saw a big box lying on the grass. It was empty and there were no one else inside. Anna wanted to see what was inside, so she tried to open it but it wouldn't budge. 

Tommy saw her struggling and came over to help. He bent down and opened the box with his strong hands. Inside was a surprise! A tiny mouse that they had found in the yard. 

The three of them sat together at the table for some food for their meal. Then they shared some tasty treats with the mouse, who followed all of them as they enjoyed a yummy snack.

Mom smiled at him and said, ""Did you have fun playing with your friends?""

Tommy nodded shyly, ""Yes."" But he also felt comfortable looking up at the sky. The bright sun made the birds sing sweet songs.

Then they saw a big puddle on the ground. It was dark and muddy too! Laughing with excitement, Lucy and Tommy started to skip towards the puddle. As they got closer, Lisa noticed that one of the leaves of the mud was slippery and she couldn't resist jumping in the water. Tommy said to Sally, ""Come on let's make the worst result"" as they were so determined about getting their way through the wet puddle. 

Sure enough, Lisa made her way up next to the puddle. When they reached the edge, she used both hands and found a perfect spot. Her mother had been watching the whole time when they returned home! With good ideas, she pulled out some special shampoo from the shed. Everyone cheered for this wonderful idea!

The little boy smiled, feeling much better now that he knew how it was done. He asked, ""How do we start?â€
His dad explained the task - that when the sun melts, its special light makes them happy. The boy nodded eagerly. 
They worked together with warm hugs, cleaning up the garden and planting seeds in their backyard. Soon they had a beautiful garden full of colorful flowers. 
The boy was delighted as he saw his yard look from above and thanked his dad for helping him. His day taught him something even more valuable than eating the sun's rays - it is possible! And he never forgot about being wet and sad ever again.
The End.
Moral: Even if something isn't perfect, there are lots of other ways to find happiness on your rainy days! Always remember that"
"The note replied, ""I am made of snow, and the sun is making me melt."" The sun felt bad and said, ""I am sorry, I did not mean to make","you suffer. Please forgive me!"" 
The snowman thought for a moment and then he smiled. He was kind to everyone, even his brothers and sisters. So he asked, ""Will you be mine?"" Everyone laughed and agreed that he would be mine! 
Everyone in the town was very happy and thanked the snowman for being so kind. From then on, he was always taken care of in the winter, but now the family had two different hearts - they were grateful that the snowman could help them stay together. 
He had helped make the village another beautiful place and it didn't seem like a gloomy day anymore when he knew that his good deeds had been rewarded with something more important than suffering. Together, the family learned from the snowman, who had an even stronger heart as part of the magical day.

"The note replied, ""I am made of snow, and the sun is making me melt."" The sun felt bad and said, ""I am sorry, I did not mean to make","you melt. Please help me!"" 

The sun was scared because it knew that this might happen if they were too hot or too cold. So it asked its friends for their help. One big bear thought he could use their honey beaker to blow out the melting clouds.

But the mist had already taken over their homes and there was no way for the bear to get them all done. The bear was sad because he wanted his family to be safe and happy again. But then he had an idea! He called a friendly firefly who told him that if everyone worked together we can put down the ground.

With that, the rainbow spread throughout everything. Then with all of the love and care from the sun's warm rays, it stopped the mist. Everyone was thankful that the fog helped save their home! From now on, they always made sure to bring extra time and help each other in times of need.

The little girl was sad because she thought her friends would be mad at her. But then an idea came to her. She ran outside and picked some flowers. 

When she went back inside, she told her mom what happened. Her mom looked surprised but said that it was ok. Then they had a big hug to celebrate! 

They decorated their faces with lots of pretty colours, like red, blue and yellow. They laughed and smiled, feeling much better. 

Now every day, the little girl hopes her friends will still have fun together when the snow melts, until there are no more melts! That's how the bitter note made them feel happier in the world. And that's how the little girl learned to look after the seasons - no matter if things donâ€™t always turn out best when it comes!

Tommy felt better when his mom came over and said ""It's okay, Tommy, I forgive you"". Ben smiled and hugged Tommy. They both agreed that being friends should be always nice! 

From then on, whenever Tommy saw someone feeling down, he would show them how he felt. Sometimes everyone was too angry, sometimes Tommy did not explain how their friendship would make them feel. But from then on, they never quarreled again - it was important for all that comes. 

Johnny was so happy to have helped his friend, Tommy and understood what happened with his best words. Now they were friends forever and enjoyed playing together without any more arguing. The End. From now"
"Her mom looked at the video and said, ""Yes, but first, let's plan a time to watch it together."" Lucy was so excited. They decided to watch it","at the park for as long as they could. 
The next day, they went to the park and saw something different - there were no animals or plants around! It was normal like nothing she had ever seen before. She was curious and wanted to touch everything.
""Come on,"" her mom suggested. ""We can look for some flowers by the pond,"" they agreed. 
When they arrived at the pond, they found lots of flowers that made them very happy. Lucy started picking them with joy. 
Suddenly, the video stopped working: All around them was sadness. The sunlight and the wind just kept raining. 
Lucy's mom gave up, and then reminded Lucy that the only thing that could make the world better would be good again. This made Lucy less upset. In the end, it all ended back into easy things and the world worked well again. The memory of playing with friends made"
"Her mom looked at the video and said, ""Yes, but first, let's plan a time to watch it together."" Lucy was so excited. They decided to watch it","in their living room.

They put the video on the big table and went to get ready. Lucy helped her mom make popcorn for dinner. She had been planning this day a long time. When they were done, she got the popcorn out of the bowl. The smell was yummy!

Suddenly, there was an earthquake! It made loud noises and scared everyone. The TV shook and it stopped working. Mom looked sad. Lucy wanted to help too.

She quickly ran over to the counter and grabbed some help from her mom. Then, they found the solution. With quick thinking and kindness, they fixed the TV shine. Everyone cheered again. 

It ended up being such an exciting adventure that all thanks to Lucy and mom. Lucy couldn't wait to go back to the kitchen next weekend with her family! And they did - having a"
"Her mom looked at the video and said, ""Yes, but first, let's plan a time to watch it together."" Lucy was so excited. They decided to watch it","and then they both went outside to play.

The sun was shining brightly in the sky when they started playing. The air was warm and everything felt great. They had fun all day until suddenly the sound stopped and everything went still.

Lucy said to her mom, ""It sounds like someone needs our help to get the video going again"". 
Her mom smiled and replied, ""Don't worry sweetheart, I know a friend who can solve problems too! Let's go see him!""

When they reached their friend's house, they knocked on the door. When they answered it, there was a little boy with his dog beside them. He thanked them for coming over to watch the video and explained that he would have to do more experiments, but he couldn't wait any longer.

Lucy said,""Let's give him something of my own!""

So she took out some of her favorite colors and"
"Her mom looked at the video and said, ""Yes, but first, let's plan a time to watch it together."" Lucy was so excited. They decided to watch it","on the TV in the living room.

Lucy asked her mom, ""Can I do it?""
Her mom smiled and said, ""Not yet. But if you can go back outside and play, we will have time for dessert later!""

So they played games, drew pictures and did fun things. Lucy felt very happy when she thought about the cartoon they watched that day. 

At night, her mom tucked them into bed and reminded them, ""I am proud of you Lucy. You worked hard today"". Lucy nodded with joy as she snuggled up tight and went to sleep. That night, Mom tucked Lucy into bed and told her goodnight. And that is how Lucy planned her favorite treat ever!

"Lily's mom said, ""Lily, you have to wash your hair or it will get dirty and smelly."" But Lily ignored her mom and said, ""I don't want to wash my hair, it's foolish!""

Later that","day, Lily went to the park with her friends. They were playing on the swings when a boy came up to them and said, ""Your dad is sick. He doesn't even pay for it."" Everyone felt sorry for the boy and his mom.

The next week, Lily had to go to school without washing her hair. She didn't like getting stinky clean and she didn't feel happy about it. When she got home, she realized she forgot to wash her hair earlier and now she looked much better. Her mom took care of her and soon she became as good as new! The moral of the story is that sometimes we might regret not doing what we don't want, but it can help us in our own way. We should always be grateful for the things we do have, especially if they are foolish to come along by herself. From then on, Lily made sure to rinse her hands and"
"Lily's mom said, ""Lily, you have to wash your hair or it will get dirty and smelly."" But Lily ignored her mom and said, ""I don't want to wash my hair, it's foolish!""

Later that","day, Lily and her friend Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big hill with ice on top of it. Tom said, ""Let's slide down this one!"" But when they tried to climb up the hill, their shoes got stuck in the snow. Lily felt embarrassed for ignoring her mom and making her dirty.

But then, Tom had an idea. He took off his boots and socks and gave them to Lily. ""Here,"" he said, ""Now you can ride your feet as fast as I can."" Lily smiled and felt happy again. She learned that sometimes it's important to listen to others, even if she doesn't understand why. And sometimes, being smart means doing what you're asked to do! The end. The End. The moral value is that listening to others and not getting mad, there are always ways to make ourselves feel better. And from then on, Lily"
"Lily's mom said, ""Lily, you have to wash your hair or it will get dirty and smelly."" But Lily ignored her mom and said, ""I don't want to wash my hair, it's foolish!""

Later that","day, Lily went outside with her friends. They played in the snow and made a big igloo together. Lily said, ""This is fun! I love playing outside in winter."" Her friends laughed and said, ""You look silly as you are 6-years old!""

As they were leaving the park, Lily accidentally stepped on some ice by accident. She cried out for help but no one could hear her. The other kids tried to help, but it was too late. Lily had already frozen in the middle of nowhere.

The moral of the story is that sometimes we need to listen to others when they teach us important lessons. Don't ignore them, even if it's hard. Sometimes, things might seem bad at first, but they can become good if we take care of ourselves. It's not worth getting hurt, so always remember to clean up after yourself. By doing this, everyone has"
"Lily's mom said, ""Lily, you have to wash your hair or it will get dirty and smelly."" But Lily ignored her mom and said, ""I don't want to wash my hair, it's foolish!""

Later that","day, Lily's little brother Max came into the room. He saw a big bottle of shampoo on the table. He thought it would be fun to play with it. So he opened the bottle and sprayed some shampoo everywhere! 

When Lily's mom saw what Max had done, she said, ""Oh no, Max! You shouldn't make a mess and leave shampoo everywhere."" But Max didn't listen and continued playing. 

Suddenly, they heard their dad calling from the kitchen. ""Hey kids, come here please!"" Max ran back to his mom who picked him up and said, ""Max, you need to clean yourself up before dinner."" 

Lily felt bad for ignoring her mom and wished she hadn't played with the silly shampoo. From then on, she made sure to wash her hair properly every night"
"Sara and Ben were playing near the cliff. They liked to look at the birds and the sea. But they were hungry and wanted to go home.

""Mom said we can have cookies when we get back,"" Sara said. ""Let's go now.""

""Wait, I want to give this rock to the bird,"" Ben said. He picked up a big rock and threw","it into the water. The fish swam down fast and came closer.

""Thank you, Ben!"" Sara said. She clapped her hands and smiled.

But then something bad happened. A huge wave splashed over them and knocked them over. The rocks fell on their feet and hurt them. They screamed and dropped their rocks. It was not fun anymore.

They ran out of the cliff as fast as they could. They did not stop until they reached their house. Their mom saw them and gasped.

""What happened?"" she asked.

Sara looked ashamed. She did not tell the truth. She did not answer the story.

Ben nodded. He felt sorry for his sister. He wished he had listened to her. He hoped she would still be okay.

Their mom hugged them and said, ""I know, my sweeties. I forgive you."

""Wait, I want to give this rock to the bird,"" Ben said. He picked up a big rock and threw","it as far as he could. The rock hit the tree where the bird was eating.

Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was an ostrich coming out of the grass. It had long legs and a black feather on its head. It looked angry and scared.

""Hey, what are you doing with my rock?"" the ostrich roared.

""We are sorry, Mr. Owl,"" Sara said. She dropped the rock and ran away from the cliff.

The ostrich chased after them. It thought they were snorting or running. It tried to catch them by their hair and tails.

""Help, help!"" Ben shouted. He tripped over his hat and fell down. He landed in front of Sara.

They both got up and ran as fast as they could. But they were too late. The whale"

The bird fell down from the sky. It was scared and hurt. It tried to fly away, but the branch broke off. The bird closed its eyes and died.

Sara and Ben felt bad. They ran after the bird, but they could not catch it. They called for help, but no one heard them. They saw some people coming and they knew what happened.

They decided to do something. They found some food and put it in a basket. Then they threw the basket over the bird. The basket flew high and landed far away. Then they followed the food until they reached the bird.

When they got there, they gave the food to the bird. The bird smelled the food and flapped its wings. It opened its wings and chirped happily.

""Thank you, thank you!"" Sara and"

Sara clapped her hands and smiled. She ran to get more treats from Mom. But then she heard another voice.

""Ben! Sara!"" Mom shouted. She was looking for them. ""Come here right now!""

But Sara and Ben did not come. Sara was too busy with the rocks and the bird. She did not hear Ben calling her name. She did not see him walking away.

The bird flew towards them and pecked at their heads. The bird hurt Sara very badly. Ben screamed and cried. He dropped the rock and held Sara's hand. He wished he could help her. He felt sorry for himself. He hugged Sara and said he would be back soon.

"Once upon a time, there was a baby who loved to yell. Whenever he wanted something he would yell at the top of his voice. Everyone in his family got a bit impatient with him.

The baby and his family spent a whole afternoon playing together. He loved it when his mom and dad took him on adventures around the park and they were always so kind to each other. At night they went inside and snuggled up in bed, safe and sound in the knowledge they had learned that day. They were never so happy.

So, with a smile, he grabbed his hand and started off. On the way, his eyes widened with excitement as he heard many new sounds coming from everyone else in town.

Grandma smiled and opened the box. Inside were lots of special surprises: jewelry, masks, candy wrappers, and more! The baby had so much fun playing games that everyone couldn't help but smile. 

At bedtime, Grandma read the baby a story about how good things happen to people in a big way. After he finished hearing all the stories, the baby gave her a big hug and snuggled up next to her pillow.

While they were eating their warm lunch, Lily asked her dad if she could throw something outside. His Dad thought about it for a moment, then picked up a long stick. He showed it to Lily how to toss a ball near the open window. She laughed as the wind blew through her hair and the lightning sparkled like the clouds.

Lily thought about it for a while. Then she had an idea! She decided to release the small celery into the ground for everyone to eat.

Timmy couldn't believe what he had found - this fur was alive, like magic! With all these love he had brought home as a pet. 
He named him 'Bitty'. Now that reminded him of his new life and how happy he felt in the dark, he couldn't wait to show his new pet to everyone. That way, they could hear them even better than before! The end.

Timmy and Bitty were the happiest friends ever! They loved to play together every time someone walked by their house. Timmy was so glad he decided to call it ""Spot""."
"One night, Timmy saw a shooting star and made a wish. He wished for an intelligent puppy to be his best","friend. His parents thought he was very clever and they decided it was time for him to go outside and play in the garden.

When Timmy went outside, he could feel the cool breeze on his face and noticed his dream of having one himself too! But, as soon as he stepped into his yard, his parents told him that playing with the puppy had been dangerous, not a pet. 

""But why?"" asked Timmy. ""I just wanted someone to do something so wonderful for you!"" 

His parents explained that even though playing was fun but it wasn't safe, it could still hurt people. They also told him that sometimes things can happen no matter how hard they try, they aren't always wise. It's important to learn from our mistakes and appreciate every moment we create! Timmy understood his lesson and smiled again. 

The next day, Timmy came back home ready for another adventure"
"One night, Timmy saw a shooting star and made a wish. He wished for an intelligent puppy to be his best","friend. Suddenly, his mom came in the room and said it was time to clean up his messy living room.

Timmy didn't want to stop playing, but he knew he had to listen to his mom. So, he quickly picked up all of his toys and put them away in their proper places. 

As he walked out of his house, he felt proud that he had cleaned up so well, even though he didn't have much hair on his face! Even though he felt tired or shaken, Timmy thought about how lucky he was to have such an intelligent little brother who loved him very much. And as they walked back into his own room, Timmy fell fast asleep dreaming of his day at school with his new pet puppy by his side. The end.

Moral of the story: Be humble and grateful for what you already have. Don't let others make you feel"
So Timmy went outside and started to help his mommy. She gave him a hammer to break some rocks. Timmy hit the rocks,"with it but he was successful! He had fixed all of them. His mommy praised him and said that he did an amazing job. 

Afterwards, Timmy helped mommy hang up some new decorations in their bedroom wall. But every now and then, he heard some noises from downstairs. It was very loud, like someone trying to disturb something! Mommy didn't want that to happen, so she told Timmy that next time he wanted to work on building a treehouse, he should get more pieces done quickly.

Timmy learned an important lesson about working hard to make the things we use, and this story showed how even if we are small, big and serious. Being independent can be very much fun and helpful. The moral value of Timmy's experience is that teamwork pays off when you build something. They show our achievements and teach us the importance of working together. That way, everyone"
So Timmy went outside and started to help his mommy. She gave him a hammer to break some rocks. Timmy hit the rocks,"as hard as he could, but then something terrible happened. One rock hit the ground, and it broke! His mommy came outside and saw what had happened. ""Timmy, that was not good,"" she said in a sad voice. 

Timmy felt very bad for breaking the rock. He wanted to make things better but now all he needed was a broken rock and a scolding. Tears filled his eyes and his face turned red when he realized it was time to go inside. 

His mommy hugged him and said: â€œI know you're upset, Timmy, but I love you.â€ She reminded him that sometimes we have to do things without thinking about how we might get hurt or forget. We just need to be careful while playing so that others don't want any trouble. That way we won't fall down on either side of the house again. Okay?"" 

"
So Timmy went outside and started to help his mommy. She gave him a hammer to break some rocks. Timmy hit the rocks,"with the hammer, but they broke because he hit them too hard. His mommy said it was not safe to destroy things.

Next, his daddy showed Timmy how to fix something else. He put his hands together so that tools could be used again! Daddy fixed the chest of broken sticks, and soon he had it all cleaned. Then, Timmy found an old piece of wood and he fixed the crack in the wall. He was happy when he made the house look nice and neat again. 

Timmy's room looked fine now that Daddy fixed it. It looked much better after Daddy fixed it. Mommy hugged him and thanked Daddy for fixing her door. They both smiled and went inside to have dinner. The end.  
It was nice of them to repair Daddy's door - even though it wasn't easy at first. From then on, every time someone needed help"
So Timmy went outside and started to help his mommy. She gave him a hammer to break some rocks. Timmy hit the rocks,", but the tools kept coming out of his pocket.

Soon all of the pieces were gone! He looked at his mommy and said sadly: ""Mommy, I broke something"". His mommy looked up and smiled warmly. She told Timmy that she would fix it with her new nailing tool. 

The next day, mommy got his old hammer again, this time even worse than before. But when mommy put the old hammer away, the nail was fixed! Mommy had restored Timmy's old hammer with just one tug on the side of it. Now Timmy could finally open and close his eyes, feeling safe and happy. 

From then on, Timmy used his hammer every day, playing in the garden, so he wouldn't break anything else. He knew he was going to have lots of fun and explore without breaking anything else. Timmy knew that everything"
"Lily said, ""Mommy, can we take the star home with us?""

Mommy said, ""No, we can't take the star. It belongs","to someone else.""

Lily was very sad and asked again, ""Why will they not let me have it?"".

Mommy thought for a moment and then said, ""I don't know. Let's ask around until you find out who is saying it"".

So Mommy and Lily went outside together. As soon as they stepped into the sunshine, they saw a little bird peeking from behind a tree. 

The bird spoke, 'My friend I am here in the universe'. The girl, named Polly and the star all smiled, then asked if she could take him home with her.

The girl happily agreed and flew them both home safely at last. From that day onward, Lily and Mommy knew the star would always be available to keep forever.

And the moral of the story: never judge a thing before giving away something! You can share what you"
"Lily said, ""Mommy, can we take the star home with us?""

Mommy said, ""No, we can't take the star. It belongs","to everyone who sees it."" 

Lily was sad and asked, ""Why? The star is so special!"". Mommy said, ""It doesn't belong to us. We need to be kind to all living things and respect what they have."" 

But Lily was determined to keep the star for herself, and she decided to make her own. She went outside to find a box that had the star inside. When Mommy saw Lily's idea, she said, ""Oh Lily, you look very pretty now, but it isn't safe to take things without permission."" 

When Daddy heard this he was really upset because he hadn't been able to save money. He quickly called the police and eventually the police took the star away from its owner. Now the family would have to find another way to enjoy the star together as a reminder of how important it was to be honest and respectful when something"
"Lily said, ""Mommy, can we take the star home with us?""

Mommy said, ""No, we can't take the star. It belongs","to nature."" 

Lily was sad and started crying. But then she saw a big comet in the sky above them. She asked Mommy, ""Can I borrow that star for our house?""

Mommy smiled at her daughter and said, ""Yes, you can borrow it. Just make sure to always return things from nature.""

So Lily took the comet out of its little hole and put it on the window sill. Every night, before bedtime, she would check on it to see if something special had happened.

One day when Lily returned the comet, it came back to life! Lily was so happy and ran inside to show her mommy. Mommy hugged her tightly and said, ""You have been so brave, my dear!""

The next morning, Lily woke up early and went outside with the comet again. With each passing minute the world seemed"
"Lily said, ""Mommy, can we take the star home with us?""

Mommy said, ""No, we can't take the star. It belongs","to someone else.""

Lily was sad and asked, ""But why?""

Mommy said, ""Because it's important that they accept our wish by taking a photo of you in case anyone has an important memory."" 

So Lily decided that she would help them understand their thoughts. She helped her mommy get ready for their journey as well. Soon enough, Mommy saw all their children playing together with a camera. Everyone smiled and waved goodbye before heading away. 

That night, when Lily woke up from her sleep, she remembered how much fun she had accepted the star that day. That made her feel very happy! From then on, she knew that sometimes we can be independent and do things that are difficult but if something happens hard, it may just be something wonderful. 

The end.

Moral of the story: No matter how busy we are at the beginning or what"
"Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to play. He noticed that many of the other children had a little cap that they all shared. He wanted to join the other children and wear the same cap, but he didn't have one."," 

He asked his mum for help. â€œCan I borrow my own pair of capes?â€ he pleaded. His mum looked around in the store and saw an ordinary cap lying on the shelf, too. She said, ""I think you should choose."" So the boy happily put it on, and walked out into the street with a smile on his face.

The other children were very happy when they saw him wearing his cap! They knew it would be useful as well, so they invited him back every day and the boy proudly showed off his new shorts-looking cap with the others. Everyone was amazed by how fast and clever he could go without them having the same style of caps. 

From then on, whenever someone needed a dress he went to the market and took off his original cap. Whenever anyone needed something extra special enough, he always thought about finding the perfect person in need -"
"Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to play. He noticed that many of the other children had a little cap that they all shared. He wanted to join the other children and wear the same cap, but he didn't have one.","

He thought for a moment, then took out his hands and started to wipe the ground with them. As he did this, some of the other kids noticed and laughed at him. The other kids laughed even harder as if they were too bad at playing with caps in their pockets. 

The boy felt really embarrassed. All the other children tried to cheer him up, but it just wasn't enough for him. Soon all of the kids in the neighbourhood joined together on their own, happily wearing the cap around their necks. It made them very happy! And so, no matter how sad or embarrassing the situation got. The moral of the story is to always try your best before letting others win or take something away from you. You never know when what might happen.â€

Moral: Be brave and don't be ashamed of what comes your way - because it can end up being fun"
"Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to play. He noticed that many of the other children had a little cap that they all shared. He wanted to join the other children and wear the same cap, but he didn't have one."," 

One day, his mommy took him out for a walk with some friends in the park. As he was walking around, he spotted an elderly man sitting on a bench. The elderly man saw them and said hello. The young boy waved at him and the elderly man smiled back.

The next day, when the old man came over again, the little boy got on their walks just like before. They went down the street together and played games until it started to get dark outside. As the sun began to set, the wealthy man called out, ""We should go home now!"" But the little boy refused because he felt cold without his own cap so he ran off towards home as fast as he could.

When he reached his house, the old man told the little boy why he found this special cap. He said he hadn't been looking after it for years! From then on, the little boy always wore the"

One day, the little boy saw an old man walking in the park wearing a hat. The little boy thought it looked funny and wanted to try it on too. But when the old man smiled at him, the little boy got scared and quickly put his head down.

The old man explained, ""That's just my silly face! I wanted to see if you would accept me as your cap."" The little boy felt embarrassed, so he gave the old man his cap.

The old man was kind and said, â€œItâ€™s okay - everyone has different clothes than others. Just ask your friends to introduce yourself and take turns wearing this funny cap. Everyone will appreciate each other no matter what they think.""

The little boy learned an important lesson from the old man; always be honest and kind. And he enjoyed playing with the old man all summer long. He even wore his mommy"
"Once upon a time, there were two little bunnies. One was named Jack and one was named Jill. They were best friends, always running and hopping around together. 

One day, Jack said to Jill, “Let’s go touch some powder in the woods!” 

But Jill said “No way! That’s too bossy.” She was scared that","her friend would break them all up so easily. 

Jane had been planning for a few days but she knew that Jack didn't want it in his eyes anymore. So Jane started to cry. She asked Jack why he couldn't come and play with her until he realised he wasnâ€™t helping him.

Jack came over and saw how sad Jill was. He gave out an idea and made her laugh by saying that everything was ok now. Jack taught Jane how to play the game - and soon they were both having lots of fun without any trouble.

This story teaches us that when we make mistakes or have a problem, it is okay to take action. We can get more work through it as well and make things better than we regret. This was even better because Jack helped save us from suffering.

The moral of this story is that courage is key in any situation; sometimes our efforts can bring unexpected rewards. Even"
"Once upon a time, there were two little bunnies. One was named Jack and one was named Jill. They were best friends, always running and hopping around together. 

One day, Jack said to Jill, “Let’s go touch some powder in the woods!” 

But Jill said “No way! That’s too bossy.” She was scared that","she would get hurt by making them come true, so she quickly stopped and started to cry. But then, a voice said to her: ""Don't worry sweetie, you won't be afraid anymore."" It was an old fairy.

The fairy told the bunny again: ""You are brave and wise and never give up on your dreams, but it is important not to let fear control us for whoever comes my way"". The bunny thanked the fairy for its kind words and followed the fairyâ€™s advice. 

The moral of this story is that courage can show wisdom and bravery when faced with difficult situations, as long as we stay determined and have courage in the face of those who do it in order to avoid fear. With determination and hard work, even the toughest things may seem big and scary at first. So donâ€™t forget to always blink if you"

One day, Jack said to Jill, “Let’s go touch some powder in the woods!” 

But Jill said “No way! That’s too bossy.” She was scared that","something bad might happen at her job. ""What if it's too hot?"" she thought to herself.

So, instead of eating a spicy honey for snack, Jack saw what was happening. He quickly grabbed her hand and told her, ""We have to resist without this.""

The next morning when they woke up, Jack took out the bag full of honey and gave Jill a spoonful. It was so yummy, because it helped prevent an unpleasant problem from happening on their project.

Jill smiled and thanked him. From then on, Jack and Jill only ate as much as they could! And when things were tough, they knew just how to resist temptation. The End. Even though they made mistakes sometimes, everyone works hard enough to find success!  The end. What a great job they did for their mission!

Jack and Jill were still able to enjoy"

But Jill said “No way! That’s too bossy.” She was scared that","something bad might happen.

Jack smiled and said, ""Don't worry! We can still have fun even if it doesn't seem nice."" So they both ran off into the woods together and played games.

They laughed as they chased each other and rolled up on the ground. In no time at all, everything seemed so much better than before. The smelly air from the forest had disappeared as well as ever.

Jill thanked Jack for being so brave and told him, ""See! I told you it would be ok!"" 

And from then on, whenever Jill felt scared or scared, Jack was right - when Jane asked questions about the powder she got from her best friend Tom, it made things feel less scary. And they had many more adventures together. That is why Bob taught Jill an important lesson - always listen to your friend Tim. It will only help you with anything!

"The boy felt better and they started to play together. They played on the swings and the slide. Suddenly, the boy saw a knife on the","ground and he said ""I'm going to pull it out"". He grabbed hold of the knife but suddenly he got scared because it was too tight for him! 

The boy looked around and found an old man who had a big knife in his hand. The boy asked ""Is this help?"". The old man said ""Yes, this is my knife. I've been carrying it when you are pulling it, so don't do it again."" 

The boy thanked the old man and gave him a hug before he ran off with his mommy. After that, he wasn't embarrassed anymore because now he knew what to do whenever he was playing. The end. 

The moral of the story is: it doesn't matter if things seem easy or how small we think can be very helpful at the same time. We should always find new solutions to our problems so that we don't"
"The boy felt better and they started to play together. They played on the swings and the slide. Suddenly, the boy saw a knife on the","ground! He picked it up and was surprised to see how soft it felt. He looked around for something that could keep him from touching it because he didn't think much of it before. 

The boy took his shield back home with him. His mom showed him that it was very sharp and dangerous. He had no choice but to go and apologize to the boy for poking her knife in time. The boy felt ashamed that he had hurt himself with the sharp blade. But luckily, the man said it was okay and asked the boy to leave now and never come back again! 

The boy learned an important lesson that day: be careful when playing with knives, even if you think about what is not safe to do. From then on, he always remembered to be kind to others too. 

Moral of the story: Donâ€™t worry about things that may scare us - as long as we"
"The boy felt better and they started to play together. They played on the swings and the slide. Suddenly, the boy saw a knife on the","ground! He was curious so he picked it up. His mum scolded him but told him not to touch it because it was sharp. 

The next day, the boy decided to use the knife again, but this time he wasn't alone - his friends were there. His two of them had been waiting for him in a bit of trouble. Everyone looked at each other for more worries.

The boy explained that he did something wrong with the knife and he made sure it wasn't too dangerous. Everyone agreed and thanked the boy for understanding. Then, they all went back home together.

Now the boy has learned an important lesson about being careful and not getting into trouble again. From then on, he always asked before using anything he found outside â€“ no matter how tempting it might be. And that is why he still feels guilty about what happened during a fight.

"The boy felt better and they started to play together. They played on the swings and the slide. Suddenly, the boy saw a knife on the","ground. He knew it was dangerous so he tried to pick it up and throw it away.

The mother said that she had to punish him before the game was over. She didn't want the son to be upset. But the boy didnâ€™t listen!

He wanted to keep playing but his parents warned him he couldnâ€™t play with the knife anymore. So they threw it in the trash and let the boy have some fun inside instead. 

The end. After all, being scared isn't always hard but punishment is just when you donâ€™t understand why things are bad. But if the boy ever needs help, don't be afraid to ask for what he wants. Remember to never be too proud of your words and always do the right thing, even when it seems terrible - like playing games on his own!

Moral: We must be kind and not act badly"

""Well, all you need to do is rub its stem around something special to make it shine"", replied the fairy. So the little girl started rubbing the petals on the herb together until a beautiful flower bloomed. Everyone around was so impressed by how amazing it was.

"Lily loved to dance. She danced every day in her room, in the garden, and in the park. She wanted to be a graceful dancer like her big sister, who wore a navy dress and shiny shoes. Lily had a pink dress and white shoes, but they were too small for her.

One day, Lily asked her sister, ""Can I try","your pants?"" Her sister said, ""No, you can't. They are mine. You have to learn how to brush them."" Lily was sad and angry. She thought, ""She is not honest. She never learns to ask before I try anything. Why would she not let me?""

Lily decided to show her brother what her sister could do. When he was not looking, she ran to his bedroom and grabbed his bathrobe from behind him. He shouted at her, ""You are not nice! You should go away!"" But Lily did not listen. She tied the belt around his neck and put it over his head. Then she took off his wet boots and coat. She squeezed and twirled and smiled. The sun shone on him and made him warm.

Lily was afraid, but also curious. She stopped dancing and took another step. She did not want to fall or get hurt. The dog jumped on the fabric, sniffing everything, and growling. Lily tried to run away, but the wind blew harder. She tripped over the cloth and fell. She dropped her fingers and socks.

"One day, Tim was studying at his table when a funny looking dog came in. The dog said, ""Hi, Tim! Can I study with you?"" Tim was very surprised. He had never seen a talking dog before. But he said, ""Yes, you can study","with me.""

Tim and the dog studied together every day. They studied how to count, add, and even write their own words. They became good friends. When they were done with their studying, Tim gave the dog a big hug. From that day on, Tim and the dog would always study together and learn new things.

One sunny day, Tim's friend came over for dinner. He wanted to help keep their love of numbers for everyone.

And so, Tim, his friend, and the foolish dog continued to study together and had lots of fun every day. And even though the joys were sometimes more boring, Tim knew"
"One day, Tim was studying at his table when a funny looking dog came in. The dog said, ""Hi, Tim! Can I study with you?"" Tim was very surprised. He had never seen a talking dog before. But he said, ""Yes, you can study","with me!""

Tim and the funny clown studied together. They laughed and played. Then, the dog sat on Tim's lap while they wrote down their names. Everyone loved how smart Tim could use the time to study with his new friend.

After they finished, Tim gave the start of math to help him learn more words from the talking dog. All of the kids clapped and cheered for him. Even though he was only 3 years old, it was fun to watch everyone. Tim was happy that he could share his knowledge with a friend. And from that day on, they became even better friends. They all played together every day and had lots of fun. The end. With hard work and practice, Tim became known as the best pupil in school. And now, everyone knows that Tim loves to study with his new friend because she is always ready to teach them new things. The world is full of love and laughter"
"One day, Timmy and his mommy went to the park to have a picnic. Timmy saw some children playing and he wanted to join them.","His mommy said it was too rough in the park, so they had to walk away from him.

After that, Timmy and his mommy sat on a bench while they shared their sandwiches and juice. They talked about all sorts of things like lunch, games, and jokes. Suddenly, Timmy heard something move behind a bush. It sounded like someone was panting. He thought he heard it before, but when he looked back, there was no one!

Timmy's mommy took out a stick and tried to catch any animal he could find inside the bush. After many attempts, she finally managed to break open the bush. Inside was an old man wearing glasses with a mask. The old man started chasing after others. 

The boys ran as fast as they could until they reached safety. Timmy felt relieved and happy that he caught the old man without getting caught. But"
"One day, Timmy and his mommy went to the park to have a picnic. Timmy saw some children playing and he wanted to join them.","But his mommy said no because they were all having fun together.

Timmy felt sad and asked, ""Why can't I play with those kids?""

His mommy replied, ""They are being rude and mean. We should be kind to everyone.""

Suddenly, one of the older kids started hitting their toys and making loud noises. Timmy got scared and ran away from his mommy. He told her what happened and she hugged him tight. She explained that sometimes people need to be nice and make noise to communicate. 

The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to others when they ask for help or talk nicely. It's always better to sit and think about how we might get along in life and not have any rude behavior like that. And even though something may seem good at first, it can still hurt our feelings if someone makes too much noise"
"One day, Timmy and his mommy went to the park to have a picnic. Timmy saw some children playing and he wanted to join them.","His mommy said no because it was too harsh out there, so Timmy didn't know how to play nice with them.

So, they decided to do something else. They ran around, jumped in the puddles and had lots of fun. Suddenly, their car got stuck underneath them and wouldnâ€™t move! 

Timmy was very upset - why did they get hurt? He looked around for help but nothing seemed to work. Then, one of his friends came up to him with an idea. She pointed up at the sky and asked if he could see what happened. She grabbed a rope nearby and waved it towards the cars. The cars started rolling away from each other, but they were really hurting back.

Finally, a few minutes later, a kind man with a rope lifted their car down and put them against the ground. Timmy was surprised, but"
"One day, Timmy and his mommy went to the park to have a picnic. Timmy saw some children playing and he wanted to join them.","He asked if he could play too, but they didn't allow him because he was ignorant.

Timmy felt sad and decided to go home. On the way home, his mommy told him about their plans for a picnic. She said that she would let him use her phone to call the other kids' parents later.

When they got home, Timmy waited for his mommy's friends to arrive. When they arrived, they had lots of yummy food on their meal. But when they gave each other a piece of cake, someone else started using it without asking. It turned out that one of the men at the party was not very nice and desperate to take their money. 

The police came and took away all the man's bills. Timmy felt bad and wished he hadn't been so ignorant with his mommy's request. From then on, Timmy promised himself that he would"
"One day, a boy named Jack was very excited. He had a plan to design the perfect sauce. He got some tomatoes and lots of spices. He stirred and mixed them all together. 

Jack tasted it and it was delicious! He put it in a","jar so he could take it with him when his friends came over. But then something sad happened - one of the spots dropped off and rolled away in the kitchen! Jack couldn't believe it.

He looked everywhere but he couldnâ€™t find it. Then suddenly, his mom saw what happened. She quickly found out and used a fork to pick up the spilled spot for Jack's messy sauce! 

Mom gave him a big hug and told him that she knew how much help he loved the surprise. And just like that, there were no more spicy sauces left to create another perfect sauce-baking adventure!

And they both lived happily ever after. The end. This was their way of enjoying the perfect sauce-baked sauce that neither would we use. What an amazing idea!

He took the sauce out of the pot and put it onto a plate. It looked so nice and sparkly. But Jack had to be careful with it. It wasn't hot or cold like he thought. 

When Jack finished cooking his special sauce, he tasted it again. This time, it tasted like something really special! The perfect sauce made him feel full and happy. 

Jack was so proud that he had designed the perfect sauce for himself. His mommy was right - she said it was the best sauce ever. And they both laughed happily. What an exciting day!  They enjoyed the perfect sauce for everyone to enjoy! The end.  

The End. Jack loved his sauce and couldnâ€™t wait to make more for his family."

Jack tasted it and it was delicious! He put it in a","pot with salt and started adding more things he found in his kitchen. When he was done, it smelled amazing. 

Suddenly, his mum came into the kitchen and saw him with the sauce on top. She said: ""You did such a great job cooking your sauce!"" The little boy smiled proudly, knowing that his work would be even better than before. With this thoughtful gesture, he enjoyed every bite of his special sauce. From then on, every time he felt sad or upset, he would remember how wonderful the sauce made him feel. 

The End. Jack now knew he could always make something perfect by turning out that way - it wouldn't have been so hard without making it look just right. It showed that being creative can help you make something beautiful! And when ever like it, Jack always remembered that feeling of being able to design this sauce. Itâ€™s"
"""Mommy, can you help me search for my toy?"" Timmy asked with a worried look on his face. 

""Of course, Timmy. Let's look in the backyard first,"" his mom","said kindly. They went outside and looked all around the yard until they found something strange lying on the grass. It was a long stick!

Timmy was so excited he jumped up and down and shouted. ""Look Mommy, I found it!"" 

His mother smiled and picked him up. ""That's not your toy, Timmy. You must never play with this one again."" She explained to Timmy that some of the nails were really sharp and could hurt someone if it broke or kept playing.

Timmy understood what his mother meant and promised to be careful. He learned an important lesson that day - sometimes things arenâ€™t always as fun as they seem! From then on, Timmy was more careful when searching everywhere. And no matter how boring something is, she knew just where to find it. The end. The End.

The moral value of this story is that even though some"
"""Mommy, can you help me search for my toy?"" Timmy asked with a worried look on his face. 

""Of course, Timmy. Let's look in the backyard first,"" his mom","said as she followed him into the house. She handed Timmy a piece of paper and some pens, and asked him to draw a picture of them. He started drawing the shape of a heart, using lots of bright colors. Soon he was happy with how they looked! 

Suddenly, Timmy spotted something at the top of the couch. It was a toy car that he had been looking for all day long. He ran over and hugged it tightly. Then, he saw his mom holding up her hand too - she was calling him again! But this time he wasn't so excited any longer, because he knew he wouldnâ€™t get anything else! 

The two of them spent the afternoon playing together, creating stories, laughing, and having loads of fun. What an exciting morning when it came to searching. Whenever Timmy wanted to play with his toys, he would ask for something"
"""Mommy, can you help me search for my toy?"" Timmy asked with a worried look on his face. 

""Of course, Timmy. Let's look in the backyard first,"" his mom","said, and so they both went into the garden. 

They searched high and low until finally they found it behind some bushes. It was sitting between two rocks that were all dirty and muddy. 

Timmy smiled and hugged his mom tightly. His mom laughed and said, â€œThank you Mommy! Now I will keep this clean, nice place.â€ 

Timmy took his new find home, but every now and again he felt happy and proud of himself for finding such a great job. He would tell his friends about his adventure and they would just smile at him. 

The end. But Timmy was always ready for an earthquake! And when everything seemed to be ok, his mom had helped him tidy up and tidy up. She knew the best way to do such a dull problem was worth it in helping others in need. 

And they lived happily"
"""Mommy, can you help me search for my toy?"" Timmy asked with a worried look on his face. 

""Of course, Timmy. Let's look in the backyard first,"" his mom","replied with a smile. She led him to a spot under a tree and there was Timmy's toy!

Timmy was so happy that he started jumping up and down. He hugged his mom and thanked her for helping him search. They continued their search until it was time for dinner. After dinner, they went outside again and found that the toy box was empty. But then, Timmy noticed something else - an expensive wallet lying nearby!

He picked it up and showed it to his mom. She explained that it belonged to Timmy and she had put some money into it before leaving. Timmy thought this was very cool and smiled big as he walked away. From that day forward, Timmy always kept an eye out for other items he might need of searching. It seemed like forever, but only after his mom finished keeping any weight or things necessary in order. It was one of a kindending family memberâ€”a"
She went to her mommy and told her what happened. Her mommy told her to look in the closet to see if she could find something else to wear. Lily found a pair of,"sunglasses that had a star on it. They were so pretty! 

Lily put them on and twirled around like a butterfly, feeling happy and cool. But then she saw some dirt on the floor and decided to wipe the floor with a leaf instead. It was fun, just as clean and fluffy as before. 

After playing outside for a while, Lily's nose tickled and she giggled. It made her feel silly but also enjoyed being messy from all the fun. When it was time to go inside, Lily couldn't wait to show off her new sunglasses and tell everyone about her adventure at school. The end.

The moral of the story is that sometimes we don't always get what we want, but it can still be very fun and exciting too. And remember, it's important to take care when you wander, even if"
She went to her mommy and told her what happened. Her mommy told her to look in the closet to see if she could find something else to wear. Lily found a pair of,"shorts and put them on.

Her mommy was so proud of her for being organized. ""You are very smart, Lily!"" her mommy said with a smile.

Later that day, Lily's little brother Jack came into her room playing with his toy car. He accidentally broke one of the wheels. ""Oh no!"" he cried. ""My car is broken! Can you fix it?"" 

""Sure,"" said Lily's mommy. ""We can repair it together."" So they fixed the broken wheel and continued to play happily ever after. The end.

But when Lily saw Jack had another car ride, she felt sad again because she knew it wouldn't be as good as their old one. Even though she didn't have a spare car like that, she still had fun playing with her mommy and enjoying life even more. And that was the most important thing."
She went to her mommy and told her what happened. Her mommy told her to look in the closet to see if she could find something else to wear. Lily found a pair of,"pants that were very comfortable for her. 

Later, when they finished getting dressed, Lily asked her mommy why people got their jackets on Sunday. ""It's because everyone is wearing special jackets,"" her mommy replied. 

The next day, Lily's friends came over and saw her two belts with big holes. ""Who wore those?"" one friend asked. ""They were your parents,"" Lily said proudly. Everyone cheered and applauded her idea. 

From that day on, Lily learned that it's okay to make mistakes as long as you try your best. And she also made sure to keep an eye out for other pumpkins, just like her mommy taught her about selling them for the rest of their time together. The end. 

Moral of the story: Sometimes things might seem scary or difficult at first, but with a little"
She went to her mommy and told her what happened. Her mommy told her to look in the closet to see if she could find something else to wear. Lily found a pair of,"pants, but they were too big for her!

Later that day, Lily's daddy came home with a surprise. He had two little ones like one sister, just as small as her own. ""These are for you,"" he said. But when Lily saw them, they didn't fit her perfectly on their feet.

""Daddy!"" said Lily, ""Why aren't these girls?"" Her dad smiled. ""They're so lucky to have such nice pairs for your age."" 

The moral of the story is that everyone needs special help sometimes. They may be different from all we do, but those can still make us feel happy. And maybe someday even things that don't fit into your life, but because together, we can make someone else happy, just by looking at our pants. We just need some love and attention. That doesn't matter, it means getting a"
"The bear felt sad and thought his friends were judging him. He walked away and sat under a tree. But then,","he heard the sound of clapping. It was coming from behind him!

He turned around to see a woman with a big smile on her face. She had a big red bucket in her hands.

""Let's play!"" said the woman. ""I want you to make me laugh.""
The bear jumped up and down with excitement.

The woman showed the bear how to bang the water into the buckets and make them splash inside. The foam filled the buckets and made the bear even happier.

They laughed together as they played and soon forgot all about their argument. They had so much fun that day that they didn't even realize how far away the buckets went and started to hear more applauding each other! 

Finally, when it was time for the foak to go home, the woman handed one last bucket back.

As she left, the bear waved goodbye"

He looked around but didn't see anyone. Then, he saw it: the woman was smiling at him from behind the leaves! She had her hands down with both of them.
The bear stepped up to her knees and reached out for something. It was soft like velvet. It was really comfortable. So the bear decided he would take some stuffed animals home to give to her friend. 
Finally, they both arrived home together. The bear thanked the woman for her kindness and went into the house with his new furry friends. They all smiled as the tears started streaming down their faces and they knew that no matter how scared or alone the bear felt, there was always a way. Even though they hadnâ€™t found a way to bring the perfect gift, they finally felt calm again. And even when things werenâ€™t what they wanted, there is still something special waiting for"

They said goodbye and went off to find new things to play. From that day forward, the two doves always found ways to have fun with each other. Whenever one of them was feeling down or alone, his little friend was there to give him another hug and make sure he felt better. It was like magic.

"The bear felt sad and thought his friends were judging him. He walked away and sat under a tree. But then,","he heard a noise coming from the pond near by!

He went over to see what was happening. To his surprise, a tiny frog jumped out of the water! It had found an acorn in a hole in its home. 

The bear said ""Hey little one!"" But the frog just laughed at him. The bear looked disappointed. Then, he had another idea. He got some sticks and tied them together with a knot. Then he used these stick to tie it around the acorn again.

When the acorn finally fit the fox's home, it made a huge smile! The bear smiled back, proud that he could help the frog. From that day forward, the bear always came to the woods to meet his new friend whenever they met! Everyone knew how funny the frog must be. 

The end. But they all agreed - it is better not to judge someone if"
"On the way home, they passed a bakery. The smell of fresh bread and cookies made Lily's tummy rumble. Her mommy bought","her an ice cream cone and she was very happy!

Later that night, when it was time to sleep, Lily had a scary dream about the spicy vanilla ice cream. She couldn't stay awake anymore so her mommy said it was okay and told her to close her eyes. But she could still hear what the vanilla vanilla was saying in its own language. 

The next morning, Lily woke up feeling brave because the sun was shining through the window. She went outside to get some more pretend stew with cheese in front of her from the vanilla ice cream vanilla. When she opened her eyes, she saw her mommy standing there with a big smile on her face. And just as the words seemed a bit better now, Lily realized she was on a grand adventure with her family! 

Lily gave her mommy a hug goodbye and fell into"
"On the way home, they passed a bakery. The smell of fresh bread and cookies made Lily's tummy rumble. Her mommy bought","her one, and Lily was so excited!

When she got inside the bakery, there were lots to choose from; chocolate chip oranges, grapes and juicy apples. She chose them all and smiled as she saw her favorite flavor - strawberry muffins with sprinkles. 

Lily's daddy then brought her an orange cookie that she had always wanted. She was so happy that she skipped out of the door just in time before it became dark. 

She couldnâ€™t wait to have dessert with her family soon afterwards! From now on, whenever Lily went shopping with her family, something special and delicious would happen if they chose one thing they liked. Even though the first time buying her the biggest and fanciest muffin ever could come out? What an adventure. 

The end. Every week, when Lily looked at"
"On the way home, they passed a bakery. The smell of fresh bread and cookies made Lily's tummy rumble. Her mommy bought","her an ice cream cone which was chocolate chip. But when Lily took a big lick it felt disgusting!

""Yuck,"" she said, spitting out her yogurt. ""This one is awful!"" 

Lilly's mommy laughed. ""Oh no, that is because I forgot to buy more from the store tomorrow.""

So Lilly started crying as her mommy hugged her tightly. Lolly cried until her daddy came in. He asked what happened and Lilly explained the quarrel about the new ice cream stains on the ice cream cane.

Daddy said he would help, but instead he added some special ingredients for the mixture - cocoa powder and sugar too! After some hard work, Daisy had her favorite treat - hotdogs again! 

Lilly grinned with joy, glad she and Dad"
"On the way home, they passed a bakery. The smell of fresh bread and cookies made Lily's tummy rumble. Her mommy bought","some chocolate bars for her to eat while she was in the garden playing with Max.

When they got home, Mommy put the chocolates on the table. She told Lily that when you open your eyes I could make delicious treats like cookies and cookies, but now it is almost time for dinner! 

Lily smiled and quickly jumped out from behind her arm as she watched Mommy bake the cookies. They looked so fine, with different shapes and sizes. Mommy explained how the ingredients are just right to use. When the cookies were ready, they sat down together and enjoyed them.

Lily and Mommy smiled at each other as they watched Daddy come into the room. He had been very proud when he saw all the delicious food! And Lily knew something special was going to happen one day! That night, Lily and Mommy went to bed with big sm"
"Once there was a little girl called Anna. She had pale skin and loved going to the park with her friends. 

Today she was feeling brave so she decided to explore the park by herself. She saw a","big tree with brightly colored leaves, and asked her friend: ""What's that?"" Her best friend replied: ""That's a tree!"" Anna smiled and went over to take a closer look at it. 

She looked up in delight - the sun was shining high in the sky and birds were singing. She started running around and picking a pretty pink flower. As she ran along, she noticed something strange on the ground. It was a tiny root! 

Anna picked up the small roots and examined them closely. They seemed to be alive when she touched them gently. ""These are special, so we must put them back where they belong,"" said one of her friends, who had already seen the garden, laughed. Anna knew this would have been the perfect way to continue her journey.

She took the thin root and placed it carefully back underneath a nearby bush. From then on, every time Anna visited the"
"Once there was a little girl called Anna. She had pale skin and loved going to the park with her friends. 

Today she was feeling brave so she decided to explore the park by herself. She saw a","lot of strange things, but one thing caught her eye - it was an orange onion! It looked very juicy and pretty. So she wanted to have it. 

She picked up the orange off the apple and tasted it. It was sweet and juicy like sunshine! Anna thought it was delicious and decided that this fruit was even better than orange onions. 

Anna spent the rest of the day playing in the park. She felt happy when she saw all the animals. Before she knew it, she was tired, so she went home for a bath. The end. 

Anna learned how important the orange place is. But most importantly, because the orange made her feel really happy inside. And that makes sense - never forget to take her eyes off the orange! The End. As she gazed into the mirror, Anna remembered what she'd seen today: eating orange onion! Now don't forget"
"Once there was a little girl called Anna. She had pale skin and loved going to the park with her friends. 

Today she was feeling brave so she decided to explore the park by herself. She saw a","big tree and wanted to climb it, but knew she wasn't tall enough. 

So she asked one of her friends for help. Her friend showed her how to climb up and then held onto one hand with his and pulled her towards the first branch. Anna felt proud that her friend helped her reach the top of the tree and be safe from any danger. 

At last they got down safely, holding hands together as they walked back home. Anna thanked her friend for helping her get out of the tree in time and promised to always remember their way. They waved goodbye and went their separate ways.

Anna never forgot that moment when her friend helped her climb the tree! It was an unforgettable day at the park and now Anna is always smiling whenever she passes. The End. Anna loves exploring new things with her friends! This way she will remember them all! She looks forward to coming back everyday"
"Once there was a little girl called Anna. She had pale skin and loved going to the park with her friends. 

Today she was feeling brave so she decided to explore the park by herself. She saw a","big slide in the grass, and then suddenly noticed something moving near it. It was a dog! The dog was scared of her and just sat down beside her on the slide.

Anna's friend, Jack, came running up to her. He asked what was wrong and if he knew anything about the frightened pup. Anna told him that she thought it might be a fox and they both wanted to help him find his mommy. But no matter how hard they tried to get the pup out, the pup wouldn't let them pet it. 

Finally, Lucy said ""We should make sure we ask around before helping our friends at the park!"" So they found their friends, who showed them the way and eventually enough, Max and Anna managed to catch the pup all by themselves. They were so proud of their accomplishment! 

The end. They learnt that even when things seem impossible, with a bit of effort and teamwork"
"But then, Lily's mom came in and saw the mess. She wasn't very happy and asked Lily to clean up the yarn. So,","Lily started to pick them up but she didn't want to stop. Her mom got angry and slapped her hand away from the yarn. 

Lily cried out for help, so her mom gave her a big hug and said that if you try to tidy it up with a few other things, maybe I will be able to find a better solution."" 

This time, after finishing cleaning up Lily was feeling much better. The yarn looked good on her hands as it went around her skin. When it was all ready to show off at home, her mom told her off for being so generous. And since that day, whenever Lily wanted to get another surprise like the one she found outside of her house, she would be reminded to always finish to help others when they need it. This way, everyone had enough joy and happiness! 

The end. Lily's mom kept her promise and soon enough"
"But then, Lily's mom came in and saw the mess. She wasn't very happy and asked Lily to clean up the yarn. So,","Lily said ""No!"" 

But her mom didn't give it up. She grabbed a broom and chok-chop all of Lily's pieces. Lily started to cry, so Mom had to be quiet. 

She put the pieces away in the cupboard, and Lily was sad because she thought no one would find out what happened. Mom just smiled and gave Lily another hug. Then, the mess disappeared! Everyone laughed and soon everyone knew why they were upset. Lily still wished she could have seen what made the mess come with such angryness. 

But in the end, everything turned back to normal. The mess was gone and everyone was glad. Even though Lily was sad about the broken yarn, she couldn't stop smiling when Mom let them play again! That was the most important thing to do. They spent many more hours cleaning and playing"
"But then, Lily's mom came in and saw the mess. She wasn't very happy and asked Lily to clean up the yarn. So,","she put it on a shelf where no one could reach it.

Lily thought this was so boring for her mom, but that didn't stop them from doing their chores together. She just decided to make dinner without cleaning up, which kept her mom cold while they talked about dinner or dinner time. 

Afterwards, Lily's mom hugged her tight and thanked her for staying organized. ""That's what makes you so important,"" she said with a smile. ""We should never forget why I always clean up after us, Lily."" Lily nodded in agreement and smiled back at her mom. From then on, every time she heard some rules, she reminded herself not to worry too much - because it will help keep our home tidy. And no matter how busy we are, Lily knew that if she had been careful, everything would be okay again.

The moral of the story"
"But then, Lily's mom came in and saw the mess. She wasn't very happy and asked Lily to clean up the yarn. So,","Lily grabbed a cloth and started to wipe it all away.

Lily looked around for something else to use but everything seemed too plain. Then she remembered her mother always said that when things don't look perfect, they just have to do them together. 

So, Lily began to pick up all of the pieces of paper and put them on her bedroom wall. After she was done, she went back inside to start again. This time, Lily did it all by herself! It took a lot of work, but finally, she felt proud and so happy she had managed to finish her task.

At last, she stepped back and smiled at her accomplishment. From now on, this would stay beautiful forever. And, from that day forward, Lily made sure each piece of paper she used every day. That way, she could easily find a special place where no one ever got frustrated with her messy yarn"
"Lily was sad. She had a big ouch on her knee. She fell down when she was playing with her bike. Mommy put a band-aid on it, but it still hurt.

""Mommy, when will my ouch go away?"" Lily asked.

""Your ouch will heal soon, my sweetie. You just need to rest and be careful. Do you want to read a book","with me?"" Mommy said.

Lily nodded. She liked books very much. She got up from the sofa and followed Mommy to the couch. There was a big sheet of paper on the table. It had many pictures and words on it. Mommy drew some flowers and stars around the paper. Then she gave them to Lily.

""Wow, these are pretty! Thank you, Mommy!"" Lily said. She smelled something sweet in the air. She looked at the paper again. It had ants and bugs and grass that made things disappear. The marks were gone. They made the room look normal.

""Look, Daddy! The marks are back!"" Lily shouted. He came over and showed her the papers. ""They are all over the place now!""

""Yes, they did. And I'm sorry that you have an accident. But I know you didn"

Lily nodded. She liked books and movies. She ran to her room and looked at her toy bunny. It was soft and cuddly, like a hug. Maybe the real rabbit would make her feel better.

She took out her favorite book, a story about a cat and a mouse. She opened the cover and saw many colorful pictures of cats and rabbits. She smiled and pointed at them.

Then she heard a knock on the door. It was her friend Ben. He came over for lunch. Lily gave him some soup and crackers from her kitchen. She invited him to join her on their train.

Ben liked stories. He said they were very interesting and funny animals. But then something bad happened. His bike bumped into the table and broke. The band-aid cut his knee and made it"

""Your ouch will heal soon, my sweetie. You just need to rest and be careful. Do you want to read a book","or sing a song for the doctor?"" Mommy said.

Lily nodded. She liked books and songs and pictures. She followed Mommy to the cafeteria, where they saw some children with bags of things. They had big papers and pens and tools everywhere. Some were dirty and broken, some were old and broken. The children looked serious. They did not smile at Lily.

One child came up to them. He smiled when he saw them. ""Hello,"" he said. ""Do you have something about your ouch? I made this here by mistake."" He held out his hand.

Lily felt shy. She hid behind Mommy's legs. She hoped the stranger would take what happened to her. But then she remembered that she helped her friends who were crying or bleeding. She decided to do whatever they could to help them.

She took out her bag and gave one piece to"

""Your ouch will heal soon, my sweetie. You just need to rest and be careful. Do you want to read a book","or draw a picture for me?"" Mommy said.

Lily nodded. She liked books very much. They had many pictures of animals and plants that could talk. Mommy picked up an old book with a cover. It had a zipper on the front. Mommy showed Lily how to unzip the blanket. Then she gave the book to Lily's teddy bear.

""This is your passport, Lily. It has some stickers inside that tell us where we are going. If I can see something better, I know what to say,"" Mommy said.

""What does I get from A? Is it fair?"" Lily said.

""Really? A wish that comes true! Your teddy will think that when it gets dark, you will find it through this letter. A wish for happiness that makes things come true. Can I help you, too?"" Mommy"
"Once upon a time, there was a furry dog named Max. Max loved to chew anything he could get his paws on. One day, Max saw a shiny chain by the side of the road and he wanted to chew it. He started to chew it and pulled with all his furry","paws, trying not to break free from the chain. 

Suddenly, a little girl appeared at the end of the road. She looked at Max for help and told him that he shouldn't chew things that weren't his to eat. She said that he should be polite and kind to everyone she meets. From that moment forward, Max listened carefully to what people say, even if it didn't seem so nice to him. And he continued on his way, wagging his tail happily. The end. 

The moral of the story is that sometimes we may not understand why someone might want us to listen to them or take our best interests seriously. We should always be careful and respectful with others who are different from us. This will save us from trouble and sadness. Always remember, if you don't have something for yourself, it isn't okay. It's better to be smart than to"

A little girl who was passing by saw Max struggling with the chain and she felt sorry for him. She picked up the chain and threw it in a trash can. She knew that sometimes we have to stop doing things we don't want to do so. 

From that day on, Max learned to be more careful when playing with objects like candy and chasing after animals. And he continued to enjoy his tasty snack from afar, just like he had been with someone who needed help sometimes. The end. The moral of the story is that even small actions can make a big difference in their lives. We should always try to stand up for what doesnâ€™t matter if it means putting ourselves back on our feet or making something else out of something. It's important to think about the people around us and not take them for granted. Even a small act of"

But then, an old man walking by noticed what happened and picked up Max in his arms. The old man took Max away from the neighborhood, leaving him lying in the street with nothing but blood on his leg. This is a very sad ending for everyone who knew about dogs without feathers. From that day on, Max never tried to chew things again. 

The end. I learned that sometimes things are not meant to be chewed properly, so we can lose our freedom and benefit. It's important to always make sure our possessions are taken care of first before eating them. We should also try to make sure they don't break down any more. That way, you won't regret your actions like this.â€ 

From that day forward, Max made sure to keep his teeth clean and healthy. And whenever something doesn't feel right, he remembers to look"

Suddenly, an old man came out of nowhere and asked, ""What are you doing?"" Max barked back, showing that the chain had been staring at him. The old man laughed and said, ""You found me first!""

Max felt proud of himself for hiding something so special. But then, he realized that the old man wasn't happy because the chain made a loud noise when it moved. The old man got angry and grabbed Max and took him away from his yard. Max never saw the old man again and always remembered his bad adventure with the chain. The end. From that day on, Max learned to be careful around things that can cause harm or trouble. And he still loved to chew but no more surprises! The end. The end. 

The moral of the story is that sometimes, good things aren't always what they seem. You might just have to"

The next thing Spot knew, the massage began to sound fast. All of the other animals started to laugh at him because his oldest friend was bald! Everyone agreed that Spot had a new best friend and was happy for the rest of their game of jumping around like this.

When Spot's mom saw that he was feeling sad he had knocked over her special rug. Then she gave him an ice-cream! It was cold but delicious and made him smile again. His pain went away, and he hugged his mom and thanked her for helping him stay cool.

From then on, Spot was extra careful around hot things. And when the sun went down, he always stayed safe. That's why Spot never stepped on the hard rug again. The end. Poor Spot now has nothing to say. What do I do right away?"". Mom smiled"

Spot felt sad but kept trying. When they finished playing, another kid came and tried to grab the girl's ball without asking. This made him even more angry. Spot didn't want to listen anymore. He kept yelling and pushing everyone around. In the end, everyone had to go home early because of the bad ending. The little girl was still upset, and Spot felt really bad. He learned that it's not nice to yell or push people. And sometimes, things can happen that are just not easy. Even if someone wants to play with us, we should always try to be kind instead of being mean.""

And so, Spot and the little girl became good friends again."

Anna ran to the woman and offered her the juice. She opened her mouth wide and tried to take a sip. But the juice was too hot and spicy. It burned their tongues and made them cough.

The old lady laughed and gave Anna half of the bottle. She thanked Anna for being polite and kind. She took another cup and went back inside with Anna.

Anna felt sad and angry. She thought someone would say she should get her milk now or she would have nothing left. She decided to look in the drawer of her closet. Maybe there were more candy or books about the same kind.

She opened the drawer and found a big jar of hot chocolate. It smelled so good! Anna smiled and grabbed it. She took a sip and chewed happily. But then, something bad happened. The chocolate spilled out of the jar and landed on her hand. It hurt a lot. Anna dropped the glass and screamed. Her face turned red and swollen.

She ran out of the room and looked for her pot. It was on a high shelf that had many plates and cups and napkins. The table had hay and fruit that Mom and Dad gave them to other kids. There were also some cookies in the kitchen too.

Anna was envious of all the food. She could not have any of those cookies. She wished she had bread or cheese or fruit instead. She decided to ask her mom when they would go back to the store. Maybe there was more water there and she could have some.

Her mom heard her crying and smiled. She lifted her up and hugged her. ""Don't worry, sweetie,"" she said. ""We will find more milk at the store soon. Let's just enjoy our breakfast together."" Anna nodded and kissed her mother. She"
"Anna liked to wave at the big cars that passed by her house. She would sit on the porch with her teddy bear and say hello to the drivers. Sometimes they would wave back or honk their horns. Anna felt happy and comfortable when she waved.

Her mom called out, ""Anna, be careful!"" But it was too late. The fireman truck crashed into the house and made a big noise. Ben and his dad heard them and got scared. They ran out of the house as fast as they could.

But Anna did not know how to stop the firemen from getting hurt. She was having fun. She waved at everyone in the real car and shouted, ""Look at him!"" The fireman smiled and winked at her.

Anna was curious about the policeman car, so she went closer to the fence where he was. He smiled at her and called out his name. He told her his address was on a gate around the park. The policeman got off his bus and walked towards them.

""Hello, little girl,"" he said. ""Do you want to come on a road trip?""

Lily asked her mom if they could buy a raven of their own. Her mom smiled and told her she didn't have enough money for a raven yet. But she knew someone who would be very compassionate with them.

The next morning, Zara noticed that her trunk had fallen off. She thought she would be able to lift it again if she had given it all her own. With every step, she lifted the trunk without falling over or causing any help, but still nothing came out.

So they ran back into their house and stayed warm until the rain stopped. They both felt safe now that the weather had gone away.

"Little Jake was a popular boy. He loved to play in the park with his friends and enjoy the sunshine.

But one day, Jake did something bad. He took a","big stick from a nearby tree without asking. His friends were scared and worried about him. 

So they called the police and tried to explain what happened. The police listened and gave Jake a big hug. But Jake had learnt an important lesson that night: never take things which don't belong to you! That way, everyone gets down safely and happy.

Jake still loves playing outside but always makes sure to ask before taking something. From then on, he has been extra careful and makes sure not to take anything again!

The moral of this story is to always be respectful. If you want something back it will be nice and available if you are a bit polite. Even when someone asks for things that aren't theirs can help. We should always do that, as if we have done something wrong or rude! You should also be grateful and kind to your friends. There is much more around here"
"Little Jake was a popular boy. He loved to play in the park with his friends and enjoy the sunshine.

But one day, Jake did something bad. He took a","big step and started running across the path by himself. All of his friends were very scared and started looking for him for help.

They saw an old man walking towards them. The old man looked tired and hungry. Soon he stopped and asked what had happened. 

Jimmy stepped up to the man and offered to make things better. He said that it would be alright if they all helped each other out, so no one got hurt. Everyone agreed.

The old man thanked Jimmy for being so kind and helpful. They worked together and soon everyone cheered when the old man arrived. From then on, the two became good friends. Whenever Jake tried to come to the park ever again, he knew he could count on his friend Jake!

But one day, Jake did something bad. He took a","piece of paper from home without asking first. He thought it would make him even more popular if he kept it on to the school slide. 

At school that night he hung up posters with the new pieces of paper. Everyone was mad at him for taking their things. But then one day, everyone said ""Please put the paper away."" 

So Jake put all the pieces back together and felt a sense of relief! From that moment onwards, he always remembered to ask before taking things.

But one day, Jake did something bad. He took a","long sack from the park without asking for permission before leaving. All of the kids were surprised when they saw him take the bag. They asked if they could use it but Jake said no.

""You can't take things without asking,"" he warned them. ""If you want to borrow something from me, we have to punish you by making up.""

The other children started crying and ran away. In between their fears, Lily hugged him and told him that she was sorry. But the kids couldn't forgive Jake anyway because they knew he was still living there. 

Later that night, everyone had sadly put aside the box and took advantage of Jake. In the end, Jake didn't find any toys in the park and felt very lonely. No matter what Jake did around being popular, Jake never found anything fun in the world again. It was a"

Timmy quickly took out his favorite stuffed animal from his backpack and put it on top of the card. Then he jumped onto the table and held up his arm like wings. He yelled to Billy, ""Go fast! I'm gonna win!"" 

Billy laughed as Timmy lifted him high up into the air and flew across the room. The card kept flying lower and farther away, until finally it was way ahead of them both.

As they watched, they spotted another bird carrying the cat that could fly the longest, faster than anyone else. They both shouted with joy when the birds brought their way. 

The two friends hugged each other tightly and ran off, happy that their race had been an amazing success. And that night, they told their parents all about their exciting adventure with"

Tim said, ""Boo!"" His friends all laughed because they thought it was funny too. They played hide and seek with their masks and had lots of fun. After the party, Tim told his mom about his brave dog, Max the dog. Everyone clapped for him and said he was very clever.

The day at the party made everyone feel happy and tired from playing in the sand. The sun went down and it got dark outside. Tim's mom tucked him into bed and read him a story.

Later, they were eating cookies. The cookie had spicy chips inside. Their mouths felt hot! They didn't like it very much. So, Tim made a new mask and gave it to them.

Then Tim saw his friend Sally. She was wearing a big smile and holding a present too. They all wanted to know where she got her present. The boys sat down next to each other. Some were playing tag or hiding near chairs. As they shared their snacks together, Tim felt happy that he had made new friends and learned about his uniform.

Max showed Lily how the bird had big wings and shiny feathers. They walked around the park and found a tree with no birds coming in. ""Wow, this is a nice birdcage!"" exclaimed Lily. Max smiled and they both felt happy that they made some friends at the park together.

As the sun started to set, Lily picked up her notebook and thanked Max for showing her all of his new things.

They walked to the man and saw that he had a big truck filled with birds in his garage. The man opened the door and let Max inside. He showed them around for some birdseed and chatted with Max while they watched him fly away. 

Later that day, Max went back home and told Lily about what happened at the store. They decided to go together and look for a good bird feeder. After they found one, Max helped Lily carry it outside and showed her where to look. When they came back outside, they set up their crayons and paper to start drawing.

They watched as the birds chirped happily in the distance. Lily said, ""The birds are so pretty!"" Max agreed and said, ""Yes, they are. I wish we could have colorful feathers too."" 

Suddenly, the sky turned dark and it started to rain. The wind blew hard and the flowers around them grew wet. Max looked up at the stars and felt scared.

"Once there was a little boy named Jack. He loved to play outside. One day he saw something zoom across the sky. It was small and fast! Jack was curious so he followed it. 

He saw it go","up to another house down by a creek. He ran over to look and found a man sitting at the grill. The man said ""Hello, I'm here to prepare some hot dogs. Would you like to help me?"" Jack nodded excitedly. 

The two of them worked together to cook a cooler. When they were finished they went back home. Jack helped him prepare all the hot dogs on the grill. Afterwards they had made delicious meals for dinner.

He saw it go","around and up ahead of him. As it went faster, Jack got tired and thought that maybe he could fly too. So he jumped off some trees and tried really hard to make it come closer. After lots of practice, he got a chance to fly over the high sky.

Jack held on tightly as he flew from branch to branch above his house. At first it was difficult but he didn't give up, just kept on going! Eventually, after what seemed like hours, Jack made it across to safety. 

At last, Jack landed back safely on dry ground. Everyone in his family were proud of how quickly Jack had learned. They said to himself: ""That was an amazing thing to do!""

He saw it go","around an old barn, but then he came upon a little animal in the bushes. It had big round eyes and bright green skin. The creature stopped and looked at him with its long black eyes. 

Jack thought this was so cool! He wanted to pet the animal so he moved closer and reached out his hand. But when he touched the animal's tiny hands he screamed in surprise. 

""It's alright,"" said the animal. ""I won't hurt you"". So Jack gave the animal a hug and they both ran off together for a fun adventure. 

At the end of their walk, Jack went back home happy. He knew that the animal would be gone soon - even if it wasn't real, it still had lots of love in its heart. And so, he smiled each time he thought about how special he had been to see such a lovely sight. The End. The end."

He saw it go","up high above his house, then swoop down and land on a tree branch. Jack wanted to get close but the branch snapped off and fell onto his knee. Suddenly, Jack felt scared and confused. His mom had been watching him before. 

She said ""What's wrong my sweetie?"" She knew Jack was scared but she smiled and held her hand gently in hers. ""I thought I heard something running behind you,"" she said softly.

Jack looked around. No one else was there and he realized that it wasn't just anything that happened in their own way. The tree branch kept them safe from the wind and made sure they didn't fall again. 

And when the sun went down the sky, Jack and his mom decided to keep exploring together. They would never forget the time that a big surprise happened and how it made the birds run away. Jack had learned an important lesson - no"
"Later, the boy lay down on the sand and stretched his arms and legs. He felt the sun on his face and closed","his eyes. Then he noticed a wide blue ocean nearby.
The little boy smiled. He had never seen a beach before!
He jumped out of bed and ran outside. He was so excited to see what the blue sea tasted like. There were fishes swimming around in it, but nothing at all.
The little boy found some rocks to take home with him and he was really happy when he got back home. The beach was much more fun than looking for treasure there! 
From then on the little boy visited the blue sea every day after that. Whenever he saw the big blue ocean, he would feel excited as he walked along and explore. It was always filled with exciting adventures! The End. Sharing this moment made him very happy.

Suddenly he heard a sound in the distance. It was loud but strong noise that he knew it wasn't bad. The boy got up from the sand and took a step towards it. When he reached it he saw two big crabs swimming around together! They were so small and fluffy! 

The little boy watched them for a few minutes before one of them had to go home. As the other crabs said goodbye they waved its claws at him as they went back into the water. The boy smiled because it was peaceful and quiet. He then went back on walking to play some more with the birds, feeling happy and content.

The little boy asked politely to explain why he was here and the old man smiled again.
""I know that your youth is special"", he said. ""Would you like to have some fun with me?""

He gasped and put down the treasure he had found. Suddenly he felt calm again - he wasn't so scared anymore!

From then on, whenever the little boy felt scared or unsure about something, he would just lay there in silence and look at that empty box.

The boy wanted to smell the perfume. So he opened his mouth wide. But then, the bottle slipped from his hand and it fell on him in the muddy puddle. The boy screamed.

His mother quickly came out of the house. She looked at her son sadly. Then she said, ""That was too bad. Let me help you clean it up."" The boy nodded and so together they went back home. 

Once the garden was clean again, the boy asked, ""What kind of perfume is that?"" His mother replied, ""It means something delicate we will never find around."" The boy was very happy because he knew how special perfume had been. And he still smiles when he smells it one more time.

The boy asked his dad, ""What is this?"" His dad thought for a moment and said, ""That's perfume, son! You can use it on your hair or your dress.""

So, the boy put some perfume in the bottle and squeezed out one of its special things. Suddenly he felt strange and silly. He laughed as he watched himself smiling from ear to ear! 

He showed off all of the yummy smell of the sweet scent in the air. Then, his mom had an idea.

She took him back to her room and helped him make some special bottles. Together, they used them to decorate the bottles with pretty colours and sparkles. It felt so happy when everyone noticed how nice their faces were.

The boy opened the bottle with his tiny fingers. Inside he could see red flowers. One flower had big blutter on its petals. He put some of the pollen inside to make sure it smelled nice.
 
The boy thought it smelt nice so he decided to put the bottle down. But when he looked closer, he noticed something terrible. There were some strange marks on one of the petals from a bee buzzing around.

He quickly shut the cap behind him so that no one else would get touched. Then he closed his eyes, making the smell go away. All was still and quiet for the rest of the day. It felt good to know exactly who took such a delicious surprise. 

The End.  From then on, every time the boy wanted something new or exciting like this, he just shut the petal off"
"Lily went to her mom and said, ""Mommy, look! There's a big tower over there!"" Her mom looked and said, ""Oh yes,","that sounds like a normal house.""

Later, Lily was playing with her ball when she heard a loud noise. She turned around and saw an ambulance come down the street. The people inside were going in and out of their cars! They looked scared.

Lily ran outside to see what happened. She saw that some people had stolen their stuff. She asked them what they were doing, but they didn't know either. So, Lily told the others to go back inside and wait for help.

Soon enough, a police officer came and caught all the people from the emergency truck. He came back home to check if everything was ok. When he got home, he gave the person a little bag of money. But it wasn't enough - it was too late. All of their stuff were gone, and they couldn't buy anything else that day. Lily was sad that her important things were gone,"
"Lily went to her mom and said, ""Mommy, look! There's a big tower over there!"" Her mom looked and said, ""Oh yes,","that's where the roof works. It takes time."" 

Later that day, Lily saw some ants on the ground. She thought it would be funny to chase them, so she did. The ants were not happy to see her because they were scared of her. 

The next morning, when Lily woke up, the sun was shining through the window. She remembered what happened at school and felt sorry for them. But she also knew that being safe was more important than any noise coming from the house. From then on, Lily made sure to only watch her nosy little world around her. And whenever something mysterious happened, she could remember to stay calm and talk about it instead of feeling angry or scared. The end. The end. The end.

Later that day, they went to the park for a picnic. When they got home, Lily's dad was playing with his phone. He stopped the car late at night and looked outside. Lily asked, ""Daddy, what are you doing?"" His dad replied, ""I am working on my computer."" 

As they sat down to eat lunch, Lily saw an attractive lady jogging around. She thought it would be fun to follow her while her parents jogged around. As they were jogging, Lily noticed a little bird flying by. It made her laugh so much that she almost fell off her chair! They continued enjoying their yummy sandwiches and watching TV until bedtime. The end. They had a great time at the park and couldn't wait to come back again. The end. The end.

"Lily went to her mom and said, ""Mommy, look! There's a big tower over there!"" Her mom looked and said, ""Oh yes,","it's so pretty. Let's go see the tower up close.""

They walked closer to the tower and saw that it was very high. Suddenly, they heard a voice say, ""Hello?"" They turned around and saw a little mouse with soft fur. 

Lily asked the mouse, ""What are you doing here all alone? Can I pet you?"" The mouse replied, ""No problem, I came from far away to make new friends. My name is Max, and I love to explore new places like this tower."" 

Lily smiled and said, ""I know about mountains too. They're really cool!"" Then she waved goodbye to Max and they continued their walk through the beautiful landscape of trees until their stomachs started to rumble. It was time for them to leave and go back home. As they were leaving, Lily couldn't stop talking about the amazing view and the friendly cat who"
"Once upon a time there was an old man and his old wife. They wanted a daughter, but they had none. So one day he went outside and followed a bright star. He followed the star until he found an old tree. He asked the tree, ""Can I have a daughter?"".
","
The tree replied, ""Yes! You can have her."" 
So the old man thanked the tree and picked the girl from its roots. Then he took care of it while he walked home with it. The old man and his wife were so happy to finally find their daughter. She hugged him tightly, and the two of them kissed each other.

They were all very lucky that day, because the old man's wife had come up with such a good idea. Together they followed the star until she reached their house in the night sky, where she returned with a gift for her father. It was a pretty necklace just like hers!

Everyone laughed as the old lady wore it and twirled around like a rainbow. She was so proud of her necklace and thanked the old man again before they said goodbye. And the old man smiled and thought about how wonderful it is.

The tree replied with a wise voice: ""I am sorry, young lady, you cannot have her"". The old man said to the tree: ""But my old daughter will be very special. Please let me keep it!"" 

The tree refused and so the old man sadly walked away. Suddenly he heard another sound and he saw something small and green near him. It was his old daughter! She smiled at him in delight and reached out to give him a big hug. 

From that day onwards the old man never stopped following old people around. He knew he could always trust them in his heart. And as long as he was honest and kind to everyone, this reminded him of how important it is to show love and kindness whenever you can. 

Moral: Being close friends is more precious than anything else. When we are kindly and loving, even the smallest of things can feel joy too. Even a"

The tree said, ""Yes! But you must be careful with your garden."" 

The old man thanked the tree for his help and took a tiny look around the garden to see if anyone else needed a sister.

But no one ever came out of its corner - so the old man kept walking. After some time, he finally saw something shiny lying on the ground next to the garden wall. He picked it up and saw that it was a kite! The old man smiled. He was very happy that he could make this little girl his new friend. 

So from then on, the old man followed the sparkling, round kite every day and the little girl never forgot him! And the two were forever friends! It turned out to be a magical moment in their own home. 

And so the old man continued to lead his youth and his little house all over the world!  His honest and kind heart was always remembered"

The tree answered, ""Yes! You can get one"". The man picked up some long branches, so the old woman with the red hat stood by their fence. She said, ""If you keep this wood all the way here you will get your own daughter."" 

So the man kept walking and eventually came to a little village in the woods. There were lots of people and animals and it looked like someone was having fun. Everyone saw him and smiled as they clapped and cheered.

The old man was very happy. He now knew that he could make his dreams come true if he stayed positive. So every night before bed he would follow the light that made everyone feel so much joy.

And sure enough, soon the old man and his wife were able to live life together. They played games, shared stories and even made friends for life. And they lived happily ever after!

"Suddenly, Lily saw her friend Timmy. Timmy was sad because he lost his toy. Lily asked him if he wanted a hug to make him feel better. Timmy said yes, and they hugged each other",".

But then, it started to rain very hard outside. The rain made everything wet and slippery. They needed someone to carry them inside the house so they could stay dry. But when they tried to leave, their house caught on fire! 

Luckily, everyone helped put out the fire and saved the day. Timmy's mom came in and thanked Lily for helping. ""You're my hero!"" she exclaimed. Lily smiled and felt proud of herself.

After their hugs, Lily went back home. She realized that she had been very selfish for not sharing her toys with Timmy before. But it wasn't real! She decided to share her snack with Timmy next time they played together. They both felt happy again and promised to always be kind to each other. The end. 

The moral of the story is that sharing can lead to good things happening by being careful with your toys. Even though we don't have everything, sharing is more important than having a lot of money. And being selfless doesn't pay you well in the end. Being grateful for what you have made you happy. So, be happy just like Timmy did when he gave them his favorite toy. It will still give you joy and happiness. The best things in life do! Goodbye!"" From that day on, Lily remembered to take care of all the little ones who didn"

Later that day, Lily's mom gave her a card for being such a good helper at school. She wrote in it too on a piece of paper so she wouldn't lose any more cards like Timmy did. When they got home, Lily showed the card to her dad. He read all about how she helped his family with chores and even let him sit next to the cards. 

From then on, Lily felt happy knowing she could help others just like Timmy had taught her to be a reliable helper like Timmy. And every time she saw someone with envelopes, she remembered the fun times they spent together and smiled happily. The end.

Later that day, it started raining outside. Lily looked out the window and saw that the rain had made everything wet and muddy. She told Timmy not to worry and that she would help him find another toy to play with. They went outside together and played in the puddles until the sun came out again. 

From then on, every time Lily went to visit Timmy, he would always give her a big smile and their hugs. And whenever they felt sad or lonely, they knew that they could count on each other to make them feel better. The end. The end. The moral of the story is that when we share our love for others, we also have something special to show how much we care about us and love ourselves no matter what. So remember to share your love, even if we are feeling poor or upset over small things like the dirt can bring so much joy.

The ball was very light. The girl threw it in the air and caught it. She kept throwing it back and forth and tried different shapes with the other players. Every time someone hit the ball with a stick or then let go of another one, they felt like their team was winning.

Everybody laughed and had a great time playing this special game. In no time, everyone said goodbye and thanked the little girl. As she walked away from them, the light ball gave off its special lightness and lit up the sky.

Daisy asked, ""Where did this feather come from?"" 
""It's not just any feathers,"" said Mama Birdie, who had seen the feather first. She told Daisy that the feather belonged to a special person. 

Excitedly, Daisy grabbed hold of the feather and tried to twist it apart. But no matter how hard she managed to squeeze it too tightly, it wouldn't budge.

Mom smiles and says, ""OK, but only one","each. And you need to share."" She gives them some money for ice-creams.

Sara and Ben run to the truck. They see many flavors of ice cream. There is red chocolate, pinkberry, vanilla, strawberry, and more. But no frosting.

They look at their mom again. Mom points to her phone. It is different from free ice-corns. It has numbers and letters and pictures.

""What is that number, mom?"" Sara asks.

""It's called a 'magic'. It means something that goes around your body,"" mom explains.

""Like magic? Where?"" Ben wonders.

""Well, if you rub this word, you can say it out loud,"" mom suggests.

Ben does not know what magic means. He feels curious and excited. He picks up the number-box. He"
"Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom. One day, they see a big truck with a picture of ice-cream on it. The truck makes a loud sound: ding-ding-ding!

""Mom, can we have ice-cream?"" Sara asks.

""Me too, me too!"" Ben says.

Mom smiles and says, ""OK, but only one","cone each. And you have to share with your sister.""

Sara and Ben run to the truck. Mom gives them each an ice-cream and watches them eat happily. They are very enthusiastic about what they will get later.

Soon, Ben feels his tummy tickle. He stops eating and stands up. He stretches his arms and looks at Mom.

""Did I drink more chocolate, Mom?"" he asks.

Mom nods and shakes her head. She says, ""No, honey, you need to drink less or nap soon. You look cute, don't you?""

Ben giggles and says, ""No, Mom, I want more chocolate now!""

He runs back to the truck and tries to drink some more. But then, something strange happens. The man who sells the last bittern"

Mom smiles and says, ""OK, but only one","each. And you have to eat your lunch first."" She gives them two cones.

Sara picks vanilla. She likes mangoes. Ben picks chocolate. Mom buys them and puts them in a bag. They walk to the truck and pay for their things.

On the way home, they see many cars. Some are yellow, some are green, some are red. Sara points at a car that stops and says, ""Look, a red car!""

Ben thinks grapes look funny. He takes a piece of his cone and chews. It is sweet and cold. He makes a face. He shows his cone to Mom.

Mom laughs and says, ""That's not candy, silly. That's paintpum peppers. You put paintbrushes on your cone before eating it. Don't eat paintstorms anyway"

""I saw it first,"" Sara says. She grabs an orange cone from another cone. It is green and juicy.

""No, I did not do that,"" Ben says. He holds his cone tight.

They start to yell at each other. They say, ""I don't care if I get what I want. You take mine.""

Their mom hears them and comes over. She sees their faces and their fashions. She has an idea.

She says, ""Why don't you swap? Maybe you will give something else for the ice cream. Or maybe you"
"Once upon a time there was a brave lion. He loved his kingdom and was always loyal to it. One day he saw a large flag flying in the wind. He wanted to make sure it was safe so he went to have a look. He was so proud of it and wanted to protect it.

When he got there, he saw that the flag","had been thrown away by the wind and kept itself safe from any harm. The lion smiled at himself knowing that the flag was gone now. 

He looked around him in surprise, ""Where did this nation go?"" But no one knew. So he decided to help and started to carry everything back to where it was before. Finally, with his trusty leap, the lion carried all his supplies back to the nation where it belonged. Everyone cheered as the bravest lion gave thanks! From then on, the brave lion was known for keeping things safe and protected. 

The End. The lion's loyalty had made everyone very happy. And that is how loyal friends show kindness and care! We can all help others in need if we use our own courage. Thatâ€™s why they should be thankful. Being reliable is also very rewarding - true friendship brings peace and comfort to each other.

When he got there, he saw that the flag","was taken away from its home. The lion wanted to help too but didn't know what he could do. He decided to surrender some courage and act quickly so no one would take the flag away. 

The brave lion gathered all the villagers together and fought with them. In their best effort they made many new friends. After much fighting, the animals started to play in peace again. Whenever something bad happened, the lion was always available for the warriors to come and fight for it. 

In this way, the animals had to return peacefully from harm. All thanks to the brave lion who had been so reliable - protecting him from danger. From then on, everyone in the village was happy! They were thankful for the brave lion who was able to bring peace to their lives.

"Once upon a time there was a brave lion. He loved his kingdom and was always loyal to it. One day he saw a large flag flying in the wind. He wanted to make sure it was safe so he went to have a look. He was so proud of it and wanted to protect it.

When he got there, he saw that the flag","was very heavy. But luckily a few days later a big bird flew into the garden next door. The brave lion had a plan and quickly grabbed some friends! They all started making a plan - one that would take care of the flag from then on. 

They began to work hard to build their net. After a while, they were ready to fight against each other's fierces. Finally, after many tries, they made their net safe and secure. Everyone cheered with excitement as they held onto their own net, happy to be part of the team. 

The loyal lion learned a valuable lesson: never let threats or enemies hurt you! With our loyal animals by your side, you can stay strong and trust them will always be protected.

When he got there, he saw that the flag","was stuck up high in a tall tree. But with all the strength, he could now reach it! So he tried really hard and finally managed to get it down without help from any of the other animals nearby.

The lion was very happy that he was able to save the flag. He had shown that being loyal will always be what makes you brave and strong.

The moral of the story is: Always keep your heart strong no matter what size or how it feels. You don't need help to do anything for yourself. It can bring us great successes!â€ 

Moral value: Patience will fill you with joy - and if we put our hearts into danger, we might find kindness and bravery in everything around us too. Taking the time to rest and find the right path ahead is always good enough. Don't forget that patience is worth more than life is about keeping. We should never forget this lesson."""
"Once upon a time there was a mommy and her little girl. The little girl loved to do things. One day, mommy said to the little girl, ""I'm going to measure you to see how","big you are"".

The little girl smiled and waited for her mommy to come back with a measuring tape. When Mommy came home she said, ""My sweet daughter, let me show you how strong I am."" She placed the small ladder against the wall and said, ""This is my way of showing how much bigger you can see."" 

The little girl thought this was very exciting! She asked, ""Can I try it too?"" Her mommy laughed and replied, ""No my love, but you can help me out anytime!"" 

So they both went off together to look at the tiny tapes that grew so tall. And every time they did it mommy smiled as she saw them and told her, â€œMy darling, what a beautiful gardenâ€”all how high we can make!â€

"Once upon a time there was a mommy and her little girl. The little girl loved to do things. One day, mommy said to the little girl, ""I'm going to measure you to see how","much I have grown.""
The little girl didn't know what that meant. Mommy showed her daughter how to use a ruler. First she put it next to a big number on the table. Then they measured the numbers in the bowl. Lastly, the little girl made the measuring sticking up. 
When the little girl finished her measuring lesson, she smiled! It felt great! Now mommy knew how tall her little girl had become. She thought how strong her little girl was! And so the two of them decided to go outside together every day after that. They would run around and climb trees together until it got too dark to stay down from the sky. So that is why their home stayed safe with mommy's help. 

And they all lived happily ever after. They measured everything as a family! And no matter what happened, life could always be full of lots of measuring people - because of it"

The little girl was so excited that she jumped up and down. Mommy put a stool on the floor. Then, she took out two pebbles from their basket. She gave one pebble to the little girl and said, ""This will make your head really tight."" 

Mommy held one of the pebbles with both hands and put it in the bowl. With a few pushes and pulls, it started to take place. The little girl carefully moved the pebble until she had two piles. 

Mommy smiled at her and said, ""See! That looks much better. Now, be careful when measuring anything before it gets too loud!"" 

The little girl nodded, then went off to play. From then on, she always measured each other around her, even if it meant having some problems! They were a very happy pair.

Mommy smiled and explained, "" measure who has grown taller!"" 

""Wow,"" said the little girl as she thought about it for a moment. Mommy pointed at the wall. ""That's one hundred inches high! Now I need you help me measure it too."" 

So they went back home and mommy measured the wall with only one hand ink that reached all the way up. Then mommy gave her daughter a hug and said, ""Now, what color is this wall?"" 

The little girl looked around and spotted lots of different brushes in other colors - one big blue, one red, then a yellow. She liked how green had been made with these bricks.

But then something caught her eye - the missing piece from earlier in the day! It had been hiding somewhere and was now hidden by a bush at the end of the garden! 

Lily ran over and found that the old puzzle pieces had been stuck together underneath them, waiting to be finished! With help from her mom, she put them all back together with ease and soon the entire box was complete!

Lily gave him a big hug. ""Thank you so much Daddy.""

"Jill and Ben were friends who liked to play with toys. One day, Jill saw a shiny scale on Ben's shelf. It was ancient and belonged to Ben's grandpa. Jill wanted to borrow the scale and see how much things weighed.

""Can I borrow your scale, Ben?"" Jill asked.

""No, you can't. It's very old and","special. You have your own scale,"" Ben said. He had just moved in next door.

Jill felt sad and angry. She waited until Ben went away for his birthday party. Then she climbed up the stairs and grabbed the scale from her table. She ran back to her room and put it under her bed. She smiled at herself and picked up her favorite doll.

But then, something bad happened. Ben came back and looked for his scale again. He could not find it anywhere. He wondered where it went. He knocked over some books and clothes. He did not know that Jill took it when he came into her room.

Jill heard Ben coming downstairs. She opened the door and saw him holding the scale. She screamed and tried to get it back.

Jill felt sad and angry. She thought Ben was mean and selfish. She decided to make him pay for her scale. She waited until Ben went home and then she ran back and got some money from her house. She went back to Ben's house and bought his scale from his table.

But when she came back, Ben was gone. The phone was on the street that someone had left there. It was a big truck that drove by with their bikes. Someone had lost them or thrown them away because they were playing with metal spoons. They heard Ben's shouting and quickly took his scale.

But she did not see the big dog that came into their yard. The dog smelled the scale and wanted to play with it too. It barked and jumped at Jill and Ben. It bit the scale hard and made it fall off the wall.

When someone heard the noise and came outside, they saw the mess in the yard and the children crying. They chased them and scolded them. They took the scale and told Jill and Ben to stay inside.

"While walking, Sue saw a big rock. She wanted to sit on it and rest. When she sat, her purse split open! She was sad and scared.","

""Where are my bag?"" asked Sue.

Just then, a boy named Joe walked up. He had a kind smile on his face.

Joe said, ""I found your bag, Sue!"" He handed her the empty bag.

Then a voice came from the big rock. It said, ""I can help you with your cart of toys if you promise not to break it.""

Sue smiled and nodded. Then, the rock turned out good after all. He opened his arms and took Sue's cart, which meant he was happy that something bad had happened so easily.

Sue thanked the rock for its help and then went off to find her toy. The end. 

The moral of this story is that we should be careful when carrying things! Sometimes we get scared but if we look closer, things may not seem too nice anymore. We must always ask an adult before we take them.

And,, even though it looked fun, it still cost some money. But thanks to this important lesson, I made sure to be gentle with little people who are willing to help each other"

The End. Unfortunately, everyone who heard their story ended up being left behind by an old woman. The end. They would still remember the day they met in the thick forest - they couldn't resist each other and began to explore the world around them. This is how Joy"
"Once upon a time there was a large forest. In this forest there were two little girls, one named Joy and one named Lily. Joy and Lily were exploring the forest and having lots of fun. Suddenly they saw a funny","looking animal. It was an old tiger!

Joy and Lily were so excited to see it. They got close to it and started to pet it, but then it roared really loudly. Joy and Lily were very scared and ran away from the tiger as fast as they could. 

The next day they came back with their parents, and they asked them why the tiger was making that noise. Everyone laughed and said that the noise was too loud! So the family stayed away from the ancient tiger until they had enough sleep and went home. 

From then on, the family never wanted to explore a strange place in the forest again. The end. From that day forward, everyone respected the beauty of nature outside. And Lucy and Joy learned that some things can be dangerous. But that doesn't always have to expect them to be brave! They could just enjoy the rest of its night together.

"Once upon a time there was a large forest. In this forest there were two little girls, one named Joy and one named Lily. Joy and Lily were exploring the forest and having lots of fun. Suddenly they saw a funny","looking animal in front of them! It had big ears and big, fluffy tail.

Joy said to Lily, ""Let's get it!"" They both ran towards the strange animal but stopped when suddenly their feet started to shake. The animal started to run away quickly and soon they could feel the warmth on their faces from all of the excitement in its mouth. 

The moral of the story is that although the animal looks scary at first, we should never be afraid, because with courage we can face our fears together. This way everyone can be brave and strong. Be like Joy and Lily! We must always give up your fears and keep going no matter what. It will seem more comfortable then something bigger than us else."" 

So, Joy and Lily decided to try and overcome the situation and become stronger as well. After some hard work, Joy's strength became so strong that finally they managed to make the"

Suddenly they saw a funny","gear on the ground. It looked so strange that Joy said: ""Lola, let's see if we can solve it!""

Lily was very excited too. She nodded her head in agreement. They started digging around the gear to try and uncover what was inside. After some hard work, the gear opened up! Inside the gear was a giant kite with wings. Joy and Lily were delighted.

The group of brave children used their imagination and decided to keep the gear as their own treasure. They held onto it tightly as they flew it through the sky. Joy and Lily laughed together as the wind blew their hairy hair away. 

They kept the gear close by for many years until one day the group had no ways out of success. So, Joy and Lily thanked each other for the special gift of hope! From then on, Joy and Lily always remembered"
"Ben and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toy boats. They pretend they are sailors and go to different ports. One day, they find a big box in the garage. It has many old things inside.

""Look, Sam, there are more boats here!"" Ben says. He takes out a wooden boat with a sail. It has a","motor and a flag. ""Let's put them on the water.""

Sam nods. He likes boats too. He helps Ben tape the pieces together. They take turns putting each boat in the port.

But then, something happens. The water gets higher and faster. The boat starts to turn from one side of the tub to the other. Ben and Sam do not see it.

Suddenly, the boat hits the wall and breaks. It sinks to the bottom of the tub. Ben and Sam scream.

Mom hears the noise and comes to the bathroom. She sees the mess and the broken boats. She is angry.

""Ben! Sam! What have you done?"" she asks. ""You broke your own boats! You could have hurt yourself or damaged anything!""

She picks up some wet clothes and wraps them in a towel. She hugs Ben and Sam and"

Sam nods. He likes boats too. He helps Ben carry the boat to his room. They put the boat on the table and push it into the water. The wind blows them fast. They laugh and have fun.

But then, Mom comes home. She sees Ben and Sam playing with her old items. She is not happy.

""Ben! Sam! What are you doing?"" Mom asks. ""These are my things. You can't touch them.""

Ben and Sam look at each other. They don't want to give up their port ship. They think it will be cooler outside.

""Maybe we can play with them later,"" Ben says. ""Can we make the port boat go faster or slower?""

Mom shakes her head. She does not like that idea. But she also wants Ben and Sam to"

Sam nods. He likes ships too. He thinks they look cool. He sees a red car, a yellow bus and a green flag on the deck. He wants them all.

They start to fight over the new things. Ben throws his blue car at Sam's fish tank. Sam catches it and smiles.

Suddenly, they hear a loud noise. It is a siren. The men calling for backup. The police come quickly.

Ben and Sam feel nervous. They know they have done something bad. They drop the toys from their boxes and run back to their houses.

""Mommy, Daddy, we are sorry,"" they say together.

Their moms and dads hug them and tell them not to worry. They explain what happened last time.

""Wow, can I see?"" Sam asks. He wants to try the ship, too.

""Okay, but be careful. Don't break it or hurt it."" Ben says. He gives his ship to Sam.

Sam pushes the box to his side. He sees an ugly man sitting on the floor. The man is holding a shovel and a wrench. He looks at the boys and smiles.

""Hello, little ones. Do you like boats?"" he asks.

""Yes, we do. We have cars and sail and bikes and dogs."" Sam explains.

The man laughs. ""Those are not real ships, silly boys. That's plastic boats. Where did you get them?""

Ben points to the hole on the box. There was no sign of any pirates and animals."
"Once there was a hot day, and the moon was shining. Two kids were playing outside, and they were having a lot of fun. They were playing in the dirt, and they were getting very messy. 

But then mommy","came along. She said to them that if they did not clean up afterwards, she would have to punish them. The kids were sad because they wanted their mommy to stay with them forever. But she did not punish them, so they quickly put away all of their things in order. 

Mommy saw how much they had done, and she could feel her heart beat faster. She asked them what it meant to be respectful of her family and friends, and they told her how it made them happy and peaceful. Mommy smiled, and they felt better knowing that this was the right thing to do. 

So the next time the sun was out, the two kids made sure to always clean up after themselves. Whenever someone gets upset or angry, they help by bringing us back our needs. Even when we get too busy playing, like cleaning up the dirt can make something wonderful happen.  The end! In"

But then mommy","came out. She had some oil on her hands. ""Be careful,"" Mommy said to her children. She wanted them to be safe. The two kids quickly followed their steps, so that they wouldn't get hurt.

Mommy showed them how to use the oil safely to clean up the garden. Whenever they played too close, it would stay away from them. It also warmed their clothes when water got into the garden.  

The family stayed nice and clean for a few days. Then suddenly something bad happened. A big dog ran up to them, growling and barking at them! But luckily mommy was right behind all the people. 

After that day everyone was much more careful around the garden - especially in the garden as it still kept them clean and safe! Now they can enjoy their time without being careless or bothering anyone else. And they will always remember to take care not to make sure everything"

But then mommy","came out and saw them from the window. She gave them each one big wipe and smiled at them. Mommy said that the best way to get cleaning is to go inside and wash up when she saw how dirty they looked! The two children happily ran back inside. 

Mommy showed them all her clean clothes and scrubbed their arms and legs with soap until they sparkled. Then she got a wet cloth from the kitchen, and began drying the dishes and the furniture. After everyone had taken care of all the laundry, mommy brought them out and hugged them both - it was time for dessert after all!

The friends enjoyed every bite of each other's cakes, yummy fruit, and even some cotton pillows! It made sure they stayed neat and tidy all afternoon, just like the night before! Finally mommy thanked them for being so helpful on the d"

But then mommy","came outside with an ice cream cone! It was so cold that it made them both shiver. So Mommy said ""let's go get some, then you won't be hungry!"" 

So they went to the store, and got their nice ice cream cone. Then they went back inside and enjoyed their snack together. After lunch, the kids played some more, but this time with their moms. 

They had lots of fun, but when it started gets dark, it was time for bed. The night was warm and cozy and they fell asleep together under the moon. 

The end! When we play together every now and then, if you are tired or sad or grumpy, take your friends out to sleep."" And so everyone took turns saying goodnight until morning. 

And soon enough, after dinner, the stars twinkled brightly and it became even warmer."
Once there was a sick boy. He had a special suit to wear so he didn't get any sicker. His mom rubbed his back to make him feel better. One day,", they went for a walk in the woods together. The dad brought out an old car and put it on the ground near them. They looked at each other and smiled as the man in the suit got inside the car. They said hello with some kind words. Then they all laughed and then ran home. When they arrived, Dad put a bandage on their arms. It felt much better when they were out of the car! Everyone was happy that Dad made sure he stayed healthy. 

The next time they went for a walk, the boy was reminded of how important it is to take care of himself. He showed everyone the things around him that help us stay strong. So every time we are feeling weak or sick, look after yourself by hand. And it always makes us even happier. That is the best thing I can do!""

Everyone liked the happy memories with each other! The boy was always very grateful for all of those extra nice things and made sure his family felt safe whenever he blossoms. 

The End. The moral of this story is that you can always help others by rubbing your clothes around you to give someone who needs it even if it means giving away something bad into action or effort, like going out into the garden to help others. That makes the world a happier place"
Once there was a sick boy. He had a special suit to wear so he didn't get any sicker. His mom rubbed his back to make him feel better. One day,"the doctor said it would be time for an x-ray. Everyone thought that was funny!

When they put on their suits and went into the room, the little boy felt even more confused. There were lots of strange tools around him but then something happened. All the different parts started changing! He saw that it was very small and could fit in his back again. It made everything move really fast! 

The patient did all sorts of cool things in his new suit and everyone loved seeing what had moved so fast. In no time at all, the little boy was feeling healthy again. The x-ray was gone and he was happy because he was now healthy! He hugged the doctor with a smile. And from then on, every time someone had an x-ray, the nurse would help them fit away.

Finally he was done taking care of. Soon his tummy started to increase. With each breath and time he got bigger and stronger! The boy felt much better, so his mom gave him some more massages with the bathing machine. When the boy woke up he felt much happier than before. 

The next morning he was feeling much better and running around outside with his friends again. They were playing, eating ice cream and having fun in the sunshine. It was one of a kindergarten. As the sun set and the ride home was over, he said goodbye to all of his friends as they went inside to rest. 

He loved spending time with his new family and taking his big deep sleeve every single day. It"
"Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. Sometimes they would see other children and play with them too.

One day, they saw a big vehicle on the road. It was very slow and made a loud","noise. It had lights and buttons and lights. Someone fell off his bike and got dirty and broken.

""Wow, look at that!"" Ben said. ""That is so cool!""

Lily nodded. She wanted to touch the vehicle. She walked towards it slowly. But then she stopped. There was silence behind her. Everything looked quiet.

""Ben, do you think this is the guard?"" Lily asked.

Ben turned around. He saw Lily's eyes wide open. He smiled. He was not scared of anything.

""Let's go closer,"" he whispered back. ""Maybe we can make it move.""

They ran to the edge of the vehicle. The driver saw them and waved. He honked his horn. Ben and Lily waved back.

But as soon as he did, he stepped on something hard. Something sticky flew out of the vehicle"

One day, they saw a big vehicle on the road. It was very slow and made a loud","noise. The people in the vehicle came out of their truck. One person had something shiny in his hand. He said he found a magic box under a tree. The magic box had a picture of a princess and an oval.

Ben and Lily ran to the ball. They wanted to see the magic. But they did not see a hole in the ground. Their feet hit the ball and fell down. They rolled away from the ball. They lost sight of the button.

They followed the ball as fast as they could. They hoped the ball was safe. They looked for the box, but they could not find it. They only saw more cars and buildings.

Then they heard a voice. ""Where is my teddy bear? I left him here yesterday."" It was their dad, who had seen everything from afar. He took their hands and led them back to the car. He gave them back their teddy bear.

The lady thanked them and gave them her ticket. She opened the back door and followed them into the street. The truck was fast and shiny. Ben and Lily pretended to be drivers and waved at other people as they moved away from the driver. They had fun making noises and moving things around.

""Mom, why is that car so fast?"" Ben asked.

Mom looked at the vehicle and smiled. ""That's a truck, honey. That's your dad driving it. He needs money for his bikes.""

Lily nodded. She had seen her dad drive before and thought he was smart and funny.

Ben did not mind. He liked to watch the vehicles walk by. He liked to wave at them and say hello. He waved back to them and said hello too.

Suddenly, something happened. The truck stopped just in time. The driver got out and started the engine. He checked Ben and Lily from far away and told them to sit down.

""Are you okay, kids? You need some ice cream,"" he said.

Ben and Lily nodded"
Tom and Tim felt sad because they were not playing and laughing anymore. Their friends saw them and felt sad too. They wanted Tom,"to make new friends, but he was very selfish.

One day, their mom told the boys that it was time for a test. The test was about colors: reds, yellows, green trees, blue water, or black apples. It also had many changes inside. Mom said that if the children learned more about things and tried harder, something would come out better.

The boys listened carefully as mom showed them how to make rainbows with the clouds, sunts, apples, and pumpkins in the field near the river. They got all sorts of pictures of different kinds of rainbows: rainbows, poppies, sunflower, and raindrops.

They started to work on each color, like red, orange, white, and blue. They used crayons, scissors, stickers, and glue. They wrote funny words like ""Lily"" and ""h"

Tim thought of a plan. He told his mom and dad that they could all be quiet and play in the bathroom. His mom and dad agreed and helped them clean up. After the bathroom, Tom's friends came to watch TV together. Tom played with them and even taught them how to sing and dance.

Everyone had a lot of fun being noisy and making messes in the water. When it was time for bed, they all stopped singing and dancing. But when Tom woke up the next morning, he was still happy. The two friends hugged each other and went back to playing games in the bathtub. And from then on, they always sang songs together at the same time! The End.

The next day, a big show started. All the kids came together and had a great time. But then, something bad happened. A strong wind blew and knocked down their curtains. Everyone got angry and threw things away. The party looked very strange now. 

Tom, who was still unhappy, stayed home with his mom. He didn't know what to do without his friends. His family tried to make him happy again, but he couldn't stop crying. In the end, no one could change everything and Tom just missed the fun ending of their day. From that day on, he never went outside in the night or played at allfives again. And every night, when it rained, Tim and Tim would go outside to look for new exciting adventures to come. This made it hard to remember its old life forever.

But soon, they noticed something strange in the bushes. It was another boy who was crying on the ground. He had lost his balloon. The balloon had flew away from him and into the neighbor's yard. He could not get it back.

Tom and Tim decided to help the other boy. They brought him some bread crumbs from their picnic basket. They played together until the children found their way home. Then, they gave the other boy the balloon as a gift. The new boy stopped crying and smiled. He thanked them and hugged them.

""You are very kind,"" he said."

""Look, mom, I have a flower!"" she says proudly.

Mom smiles and hugs Lily. ""You are right, sweetie. Your flower is very nice. But what will you do with it?""

Lily thinks for a moment. She remembers something her grandma gave her. ""I want to bury my flowers,"" she says. ""Then they will be safe from birds.""

Mom nods and helps Lily put her toys and blankets away. Then they go to her room and find a good spot. Mom gets some tape and stickers and tells Lily to help her dig a hole under the window sill. They work together until everything is quiet.

When they finish, Lily runs back to the garden and covers the holes with more plastic sticks. Mom helps her put her flowers on top of them too"

Lily feels sad. She did not mean to hurt the flower's feelings. She said, ""I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to see how many flowers were in the garden. I thought they would be pretty.""

Her mom hugs her and says, ""It's okay, Lily. Everyone is different and special. You have each other, and that's more important than any flower. And you know what? Sometimes, things get old and start to rot"

Then she hears a knock on the door. She opens it and see a man with a big bag. He takes out some words from his pocket and smiles. He looks nice and friendly.

Lily nods and jumps for joy. She runs back to the basket with her mom, who helps her dig holes in the dirt. They fill their arms with soil and some small rocks. Then they water them gently and watch them grow. Soon, they see a green bud on the top of the hole. It has a funny picture and a round center.

""Wow, this flower"
