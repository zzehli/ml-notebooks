Question: prime factors of 121
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: smallest_prime_factor with args {'n': 121}
action_sequence: Thought: I need to find the smallest prime factor of 121.

Action: smallest_prime_factor with args {'n': 121}
Observation: the result of the smallest_prime_factor with {'n': 121} call is 11

--------------------------------
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: save_factors with args {'num': 11}
action_sequence: Thought: I've found a prime factor of 121, now I will save the result of the tool call, which is 11.

Action: save_factors with args {'num': 11}
Observation: the result of the save_factors with {'num': 11} call is None

--------------------------------
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: divide with args {'n': 121, 'd': 11}
action_sequence: Thought: I've found the smallest prime factor of 121, next I will perform the same process for the quotient, which is 121 divided by 11.


Action: divide with args {'d': 11, 'n': 121}
Observation: the result of the divide with {'n': 121, 'd': 11} call is 11

--------------------------------
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: smallest_prime_factor with args {'n': 11}
action_sequence: Thought: I need to find the smallest prime factor of 11.


Action: smallest_prime_factor with args {'n': 11}
Observation: the result of the smallest_prime_factor with {'n': 11} call is 11

--------------------------------
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: save_factors with args {'num': 11}
action_sequence: Thought: I've found a prime factor of 11, now I will save the result of the tool call, which is 11.


Action: save_factors with args {'num': 11}
Observation: the result of the save_factors with {'num': 11} call is None

--------------------------------
Press Enter to continue...
performing tool call: get_factors with args {}
action_sequence: Thought: Because the smallest prime factor of 11 is itself, now I will return the factors I have found so far.



Action: get_factors with args {}
Observation: the result of the get_factors with {} call is [11, 11]
