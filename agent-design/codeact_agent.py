"can you create 100 random data points (each with a dimension of 2) and create a scatter plot. Run a k-means to cluster them and visualize it."

# first generate 100 random points

# ==============

# visualize it using a scatter plot

# ==============

# let's run the k-mean algorithm to cluster them

# ==============

# visualize the cluster labels
